         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THeſe Sermons coming abroad into the world, I thought meet to command them to viſit and ſalute you, where they firſt drew their breath.</p>
            <p>They have formerly been preached to your ears, they are now preſented to your eyes; the Lord print them upon your hearts. I take it to be my duty, (though I be the lowermoſt of the uſhers in Chriſt's School, yet) according to the meaſure of my talent, to try all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions for the weal of your ſouls; and how would mine heart be enlarged with thanks to the Lord, if my poor endeavours might be crowned with ſucces? and though theſe things have been communicated to you formerly, yet (becauſe we are ſlow to receive and retain divine truths) to write the ſame things, that I have ſpoken, to me ſhall not be grievous; and to you I hope the Lord will make it ſafe: Nay, though my ſervice for your ſouls in any kind were doubled, yea, treble, yet ſhould I abundantly rejoyce in the labour of the
<pb facs="tcp:170336:3"/> hardeſt tasks, if thereby through the aſſiſtance of the Almighty, I might ſee Satans forts taken, and forces routed, and ſin marching out of your hearts and lives with bag and baggage, and the Lord Jeſus with the bleſſed train of his ſpirit's graces enthroned and ſet up in the midſt of you. To which end Iearneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire that the Lord would be pleaſed to bleſs this, &amp; all my other labours; &amp; that you would be pleaſed to accept of my counſel, as in the Book, ſo in this Epiſtle. And that</p>
            <p>1. More generally. 2. More particularly, with reſpect to the enſuing Treatiſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. More generally.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Take heed of error and hereſie. They are reckoned in Scripture amongſt the works of the fleſh. They are the ſecret underminers of that which is good, notwithſtanding their well-complexioned face.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Get knowledge. Ignorance is the root of iniquity. In times of light to live in darkneſs is moſt ſad.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Do not impriſon, but improve your knowledge. <hi>To him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin,</hi> [with a witneſs] <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 17. Knowledge without grace, is but like a jewel in a ſwines ſnout, or a pearl in a toads head.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Keep cloſe to the Ordinances. Keep up in your hearts a love to them. Come once to
<pb facs="tcp:170336:3"/> ſlight and turn your back upon them, and you put the reins into the Divels hands.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Love ſound and ſoulſearching preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; never diſtaſte it, it is beſt for your ſouls; it is wholeſome though not toothſome.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Be much in examination of your ſelves; weigh your ſelves in God's ſcales: will you know every thing, and be ignorant only of the ſtate of your ſouls?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Content not your ſelves with a form, but look afte the power of godlineſs; the name without the nature of a Chriſtian will little avail you: forget not what I have taught you from <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 21..</p>
            <p n="8">8. Take heed of the world, and the cares thereof. Do not ſo faſten your thoughts to earth, as to be ſtrangers to heaven. Be not ſo careful of your bodies, as to be careleſs of your ſouls.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Look to your families: let Chriſt come in there. Train up your children and ſervants religiouſly; let your houſes be as ſo many Churches. Neglect here is the corrupted ſpring that ſends forth puddle-ſtreams into Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical and Civil ſocieties; without the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, your houſes will be but the Divels ſhops.</p>
            <p n="10">10. In your places diſcountenance ſin and profaneſs; encourage goodneſs. Improve your power, eſtate, age, &amp;c. for Chriſt's glory.</p>
            <p n="11">
               <pb facs="tcp:170336:4"/> 11. Maintain love towards each other; follow peace and holineſs; Love is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent grace.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Be very careful to ſanctifie the Lord's Sabbaths publikely and privately: They are God's dole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> days; be not unwilling to wait at the poſts of his gates for his alms.</p>
            <p n="2">2. More particularly with reſpect to the enſuing Treatiſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Look upon this little piece as an help to bring to remembrance what hath formerly been taught you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Take the counſel therein as from your Miniſter, Friend, and Lover, who earneſtly deſires your eternal ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Read it not out of novelty, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Pray over it, and for me, that I may be the better enabled to diſcharge my duty in watching over your ſouls.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Compare it with the Scriptures, and ſo far as it harmonizeth with them embrace it. I ſhall here put a period, and conclude, not ceaſing to be mindful of you at the throne of grace, and to make mention of you in my prayers, who am</p>

            <p>I ſerved a full apprentiſhip with you in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, wherein my deſign and deſire was the converſion of your ſouls. Theſe papers I ſend after my former pains with you, to ſecond what I then taught you. The Spirit as principal bleſs both the one and the other to you. I called you often in the name of Chriſt to come to Chriſt, and I hope it was not wholly without effect on ſome. My love conſtrains me to call again in this enſuing Treatiſe, which while you are reading, I hope I ſhall be praying that God would proſper it to you.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170336:5"/>
            <p> Be convinced of the danger of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural condition.

I pray that he that ſuccenturiates, and is come in my room, may reap the harveſt of my ſeed-time; and if what was ſown and came up then but thin, may grow up now to full ears of corn; it ſhall through grace be a cordial to my ſpirit: Love and cheriſh that light which burns among you. Take heed of the infection of error. Be diligent hearers, and not only ſo, but alſo dutiful practicers of the Word.</p>

So far as I know mine own heart, (though the heart of man, and ſo mine is very deceitful) I profeſs ſeriouſly, that how low ſoever your condition ſhould be for temporals, yet if the Lord would be pleaſed to beſtow a new heart upon you, I ſhould abundantly rejoyce, yea, more than to ſee you ſit upon the higheſt pinacle of worldly advancement. I am full of fears and deſires in reference to your ſouls good; and though now you be tender and young, and ſo little ſenſible, and not ſo fit for this or other books, yet if it pleaſe God to lengthen out the thread of your lives, which I pray for, then take a word of advice from your father: oh that God would bleſs it to you!</p>
            <p>Study throughly the nature of original ſin, and that pravity that is diffuſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your natures.

Let the Scriptures be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in your eyes; they are the book of books; read them often, and heedfully. Make great conſcience of obedience to your parents and ſuperiors. <hi>Remember</hi> your

            <p>RElations and friendſhip are the pillars of human ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, great comforts of our lives; love is the ſinew of friendſhip, and religion is the life of this love. What is love without religion, but a ſenſual affection? and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance without love, but flattery and diſſimulation? ſo that religion is the centre to the lines of love and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and that wherein they live and have their being. <hi>Non nobis ſolum nati ſumus, We were not born for our ſelves alone,</hi> ſaid the Heathen Orator. And if for others, for their good; and if for their good, then their beſt good, or their good in the beſt reſpects thereof. God made and knit us together in bonds, not to further or let each other alone in ſin, (which we are apt to do through the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of baſe fleſh) but to admoniſh and help each other on towards grace and glory. Though I muſt confeſs I fail too much in the duty of every of my relations wherein I ſtand; yet I bleſs God that he hath helped and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged me in ſome meaſure to deal with divers of you in the way of private admonition, which I hope hath not been altogether fruitleſs. It is a precious duty, I wiſh it were more put in uſe and practice.</p>
            <p>I have had ſometimes wiſhes (though the thing can hardly be attained) that we might all meet together at ſome times, (eſpecially we that are more neerly related to each other) not only for civil ſociety, but alſo and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally for ſpiritual advantage. In ſome meaſure I may have my deſire, meeting with you all by counſel and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in this Book; and oh that God would ſo bleſs it (for which I deſire to bend my knees, and lift up mine heart every day) that we might one day meet with each other in the preſence of God in the higheſt heavens. Come, let
<pb facs="tcp:170336:8"/> me beg your hearts for the Lord; let the words of a Brother, Kinſman, Friend, in the name of Chriſt prevail with you. Who knows but God allied me to, and gave me acquaintance with any of you for ſuch an end and purpoſe as this?</p>
            <p>Some of you may be yet knee-deep and more in the clay of a natural condition, ſtanding at a great diſtance from the father of light. The Lord pull your feet out, and ſet them on the rock <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others of you may be waſhed and whited over with civility and common profeſſion; but remember, that <hi>not every one that ſaith, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven.</hi> Pardon me that I hint you of ſin, and the danger of a natural condition; it was mine own condition once, and whether I have yet fully paſſed it I have much cauſe to fear, I find my heart ſo carnal, ſold under ſin.</p>
            <p>Others of you may have ſome early glimmerings of the ſpirit dawning upon your ſouls. The Lord cauſe the ſun of righteouſneſs to riſe upon you with healing under his wings, and bring your bloomings and buddings to ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and maturity.</p>
            <p>Some others may have a through work of grace upon their hearts; the Lord make ſuch thankful, (for it is an ineſtimable mercy) and keep their feet that they fall not.</p>
            <p>Various are your conditions in regard of temporals and ſpirituals; various are your relations to, and acquaintance with me: whatſoever the one or the other be, let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be a bar to keep you from accepting the counſel of the holy Ghoſt, which is ſent in love, let it therefore be ſo taken. I would not theſe things ſhould be a witneſs againſt you or me another day; The Lord therefore for his Chriſt's ſake ſo ſanctifie theſe truths to us, and us by theſe truths, that we may all attain to grace and increaſe thereof, to the comfort of our own ſouls, to the praiſe and glory of God by Chriſt.

            <p>THou mayſt wonder to ſee me add to the pile and heap of books. Not glory, nor gain (unleſs of God, of ſouls) (though my heart be very evil, and have the ſeeds of all ſin in it) are the wheels on which I move in this labour. Not affectation, but affection to my heavenly Father, to my earthly Friends, put me on to this. Some years ſince in my publike preaching. I went through the chief heads in Divinity, and when I came to this of Effectual Calling, I inſiſted the longer upon it, becauſe it was very practical, and of great concernment. I found it then making ſome impreſſion, I hope it may do ſo now; if but one ſoul be thereby turned in to the Lord, it is worth my pains, though a thouſand times more. I was deſirous to communicate it to my friends, to whom I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, for their good if the Lord be pleaſed to bleſs it. It had been a weary task to have tranſcribed many copies; I was reſolved therefore to take the ſhorteſt cut. It is a complaint that the Preſs is oppreſſed, and not without cauſe; yet much Printing I think is no more to be indicted then much Preaching, if ſo be the matter be ſound and ſavoury. That feminine toleration that Midwives ſo many ſpurious births into the world, and that licentious liberty whereby any one and any thing may preach and be preached, are well worthy of cenſure and ſharp animadverſions, it is hard to ſay which more. Much reading is a wearineſs to the fleſh, and ſo may much hearing, yet if either be rendred under God a means of conviction and converſion to the ſpirit it is no matter. <hi>Daniel</hi> got knowledge of things of concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by books, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 2. I ſee the Lord owneth and bleſſeth reading as well as hearing, printing as well as preaching. (though of all means of grace I take <hi>preaching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to be the King:) Mine own ſoul through the mercy of God (for ever bleſſed be his name) hath received ſome good (if it be not preſumption to ſay ſo) that way, as well as by the preaching
<pb facs="tcp:170336:9"/> of the word; and though this be drawn up by a weak worthleſs creature, yet God I ſee ſometimes makes uſe of, and bleſſeth a wooden as well as a golden inſtrument. And though hereby I expoſe my ſelf who am weak to the acute judgement of parted and learned men, yet I weigh it not, if but one ſoul may be gained and brought in to God by this ſervice, as I hope there ſhall, and the Lord raiſeth mine heart to ſome comfortable expectation thereof. What a rejoycing would it be to me, if my poor labours might tend to the enlargement of my ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns Kingdom? Reader, I ſhall no further apologize for, or give an account of this undertaking, though more might be ſaid. I deſire thine earneſt prayers, that while I give theſe counſels and cautions to others, my ſelf may not be a caſt-away, as thou haſt mine.

Col. 1. 11, 12. <hi>Which hath made us meet to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in light; who hath delivered us from the power of darkneſſe, and hath tranſlated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son.</hi> Where I ſuppoſe dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not onely meant of ignorance, which is one part of a natural Eſtate, but alſo of ſin in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, which is ſometimes called by the name of <note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 5, 6.</note> darkneſs; wherewith as with a thick Cloud the whole Man is envelopped &amp; wrapped. 1 Pet. 2. 4, 5. <hi>To whom coming as unto a living Stone; ye alſo as lively Stones are built up a Spiritual Houſe, an Holy Prieſthood to offer up Spiritual Sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> So likewiſe the 1. of <hi>James,</hi> Verſe 18. I ſhall a little unfold this rich hanging, that you may have a more full view of it: It is a Work, not a Notion, chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170336:12"/> fancy, or conceit: but a real Work.</p>
                  <p>It is the firſt Work upon the Soul: Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <note place="margin">Electio eſt amor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinativus, non colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivus.</note> is without, this within: Predeſtination is in the heart of God, this is Gods coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of Man; that did ordain, this doth order.</p>
                  <p>Sanctification, (for ſome diſtinguiſh it from <note place="margin">Aſſemb. Confeſ.</note> effectual calling, though others do not,) and perſeverance, &amp;c. are after, this before; this marcheth in the Head of the Heavenly Troop, and bleſſed Train of Gods Works upon the Soule.</p>
                  <p>It is a ſpecial Work, not a common, which the reprobate may have: it is a diſtinguiſhing through Work; not ſuch a work as a Man may have, and yet come ſhort of the glory, becauſe ſhort of the grace of God; and be left many miles on this ſide the Region of happineſſe: it is not onely a ſaving, but a truely Sanctifying Work, as ſome diſtinguiſh; and ſo Sanctifying as indeed ſaving, not onely in that mean and potentially, but in the end and actually.</p>
                  <p>It is the Work of Gods Spirit, the poſterity of the Holy-Ghoſt. 3 John 6. 8. It is the blowing, or breathing of the Spirit; the Child of Heaven: all the meanes in the World cannot make a Saint without the influence of the Spirit; yet that works by the Word, that is the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the hand of the Spirit, for the new moulding of ſinful hearts.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit and the Word go together: the Spirit primarily, the Word ſecondarily, the one as Maſter, the other as Servant.</p>
                  <p>And theſe Work not upon a part, but the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170336:13"/> whole: This Work is diffuſive, and ſpread throughout the whole Man; Soul and Body; inwards and outwards: It is the bringing them out of nature; from a Dungeon to a Court; from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan;</hi> from ſin to Sanctity; from graceleſſeneſſe to graciouſneſs; from the Suburbs of Hell to the City of God: The Soul is now led by the Spirits hand from ſelf, from natural, ſinful, moral, Religious ſelf to Chriſt, who is all in all unto it.</p>
                  <p>Now obeying the call of the Spirit, (who leads it in clean wayes) it walkes ſtrictly: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Soul was in the Field of ſin, now in the Garden of grace; before in the common Road of ungodlineſſe, now in the private walk of Piety; before it was Lawleſſe, now it walks by Rule and Line.</p>
                  <p>And what is the end of all this? Is it not Peace here, and Peace hereafter? Bleſſedneſs <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. 1.</note> in poſſeſſion, bleſſedneſs in reverſion: Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Holineſs are Confederates, are Twins: But more than this, it tends to Gods glory: Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> Doxologize, praiſe, give thanks for this? Col. 1. 12. Gods glory is the great, <note place="margin">

                  <p>Thus have I deſcanted upon this bleſſed Work, an Embleme whereof in a good meaſure you have in the Parable of the prodigal Son.</p>

Much work, and many works hath a Chriſtian to do; There is the foſtering of faith, the renewing repentance, ſubduing of ſin, conquering corruption, guarding his grace, fearing his falling, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his walking, ſtudying the Scriptures, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing the promiſes, converſing with converts, admoniſhing acquaintance, defying the Divel, growing in grace, and in all glorifying his God; and as the Apoſtle ſaith in another caſe, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16.</note>

Beſides, in youth there is bodily ſtrength for the task of duties; for the body as well as the ſoul is to be and do for God; and ſpiritual ſervices take a tincture from the bodies temper: Though the ſpirit be willing,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170336:46"/> yet the leſſe will be done if the fleſh be weak; fervent prayer, frequent meditation of God, his works, his word; of it ſelf, its ways, its wants; ſolemn faſtings, whether publike or private; much reading, often hearing, ſelf examining; for which and many more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite the vigor of the ſouls powers, the viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity <note place="margin">Meus ſanein corpore ſano.</note> of the bodies parts; which in age do age; lurk and languiſh; grow feeble and faint; the former whereof are evacuated in regard of ſpirits, the latter enervated in regard of ſtrength.</p>

                  <p> If were better for people to enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they find theſe graces in themſelves, than which is firſt: the ſincerity of them in reference to truth is more to be ſought after, than the priority of them in reference to time: it were more profitable to queſtion our participation, than their precedency, yet people had rather deal with Metaphyſicks, than Morals; with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional rather than neceſſary points: and love to riſe to the clouds in their askings, when they cannot reach the top of a low-built anſwer: However I will in ſome meaſure ſatisfy this queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt know that all habits of grace are infuſed together; the habits are put in to the ſoul at one time, though ſome may put out themſelves by actings before one another; <hi>A new heart will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you.</hi> Ezek. 36. 26, 27.

                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, in nature: As the ſhooting of a Gun with a Bullet, and the killing of any one thereby may be together in time at the ſame inſtant; yet the ſhooting is before the ſlaughter, in nature as the cauſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things I lay down as preparatives, now briefly to the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The habits of faith and repentance are plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſet in the heart at one inſtant: there is no difference of time there.</p>

                  <p>4.

                  <p>To run upon miſtakes in temporals, may be great detriment, but to do it in ſpirituals, is like to prove grievous damnation: Is thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ever the better for ſuch conceptions?

Verily Friends, this is a Lamentation, and there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſhould be for a Lamentation. If you call your Child, or Servant often to come to you, and they move not, how doth it trouble you? How do you think the Lord will take it at your hands, that come not after ſo many ſendings for? You have often heard of Chriſt and repentance, but yet you will not accept of the one, nor act the other. You have often been intreated to cloſe with Gods will, and you would never yet enter upon his waies. You can denie none of this that I ſay: Your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tells you the ſame; what, not changed after all this? what a wretched creature art thou, that makeſt not the Lord welcome after all his journeies from Heaven to thee? Had you had but one call, it had been a great evil to have ſlighted it, but when you have had ſo many, how great muſt your contempt needs be?
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170336:99"/> For the Lord to ſend Servant after Servant, to require repentance, to call to converſion, and you to return no ſutable Fruits, to give no demonſtratious of ought, but barreneſſe is a ſin of no inferiour nature.

It is ſtrange and ſad, that you are ſo ſtubborn, that you will not be drawn with the Silken cords, and Golden bands of promiſes; ſo ſtout, that the diſcharge of God's Canon threatning doth not make you ſtoop; ſo rebellious, that the Authoritie of God's Command doth not awe thee; ſo ſtiffe, that his angrie chiding doth not make thee bend. The Lord hath hung out his white Flag firſt, and then his black Flag; and yet thou

He hath called thee in a tempeſt, and in a calm; He hath uſed fair means and foul; what, are you ſo croſſe, that nothing ſhall pleaſe you? Is your mouth ſo out of taſt, that nothing can be well reliſhed with thee? Are you ſo averſe, that you will ſhunne God in all theſe wayes and pathes, wherein he comes to meet with you?

                  <p>He hath come to you with a rod in his hand, with chidings in his mouth: he hath come alſo in love, and in the ſpirit of meekeneſſe too.

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170336:101"/> yet when the Lord bars up that, he can let it in by the eye; but you have not improved your talent of reading; you have been like the unprofitable ſervant, that hid his Lords <note place="margin">

Not to read is very ſad; and ſuch have not performed the part of loving Parents, who have not given their children ſo good education, they are like to hold up their hands for it at the bar another day, without repentance: and thou alſo art in fault thy ſelf, for thou mighteſt have learned to read, and thou wouldeſt not give thy mind to it: or thou maieſt learn to read yet; but thou haſt many excuſes, thou art too old. Indeed we are alwayes too young, or too old, to that which
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:170336:102"/> is good; you have your ſenſes and memory vigorous enough for other things, and why not for this? There wanteth only a will; I <note place="margin">Sola vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate quiſque efficitur. Plut.</note> have read of one <hi>Eurydice</hi> a noble Lady, who being a Slavonian born, and moſt barbarous, yet for the inſtruction of her own children, ſhe took pains to learn good letters, when ſhe was well ſtept in yeers. And ought not the life of our ſouls to be as dear to us as the children of our body? And though your ſight be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from you now, yet time was when you had the uſe of it, and it may be for not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of it aright, God hath deprived thee of it; therefore that cloke of excuſe is not long enough. And though you cannot read, yet it may be ſome of yours can; though not the Parent, yet the poſterity; though not the Maſter, yet the man; and you may hear them. God hath not denied you your ſence; or if none in the houſe can read, which ſometimes falls out, (a woefull thing it is,) yet you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a gift of hearing, muſt wait upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like preaching of the word the more. The Philoſophers ſay, that nature is an indulgent mother, and where ſhe is defective in one kind, ſhe is redundant in another, and what ſhe ſubtracts from one faculty, or ſence, ſhe gives to another, and ſo doth compenſate, and make amends; as thoſe to whom ſhe denies ſight, ſhe gives the bettet memory, &amp;c. So we wanting one faculty, or ſence, which might be very ſubſervient for our ſouls good, ſhould labour to make double, and ſo much the more improvement of that we have. But thou, though

Thou art willing thine ears ſhould be as wickets, to let in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed talk, but art loath to open them as gates to let in worthy truths: do you think you ſhall have any excuſe, who have been intruſted with ſuch a talent, as this is?

God hath given you time for good duties, and if you give it away to the Devil and ſin, will it be a currant excuſe to ſay you had none? You have time to riot, but none to read; you have time to hunt, but none to hear: ſay, you have much ado to ſtruggle with poverty, and your day labour drinks up your time, yet you find ſome hours to waſt, and ſpend impertinently: Oh, if you did but lay out that time in ſpiritual induſtry, which you loyter away in ſinful idleneſſe, how much might your ſoul be advantaged? yet ſay, you had no vacant time, a wiſe man or woman <note place="margin">

Thou maieſt not do the worlds works on this day, and yet rather than thou wilt do ought for thy ſoul, thou wilt trifle, and truant away this golden ſeaſon moſt wretchedly. It is a great burden to thee to give a few hours atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in publike aſſemblies. How many vain words, worldly, yea, wicked works paſſe from thee on that day? The Sabbath is ſo irkeſome to thee, that thine heart many times ſaith as they, <hi>When will the new Moon be gone, that we may ſell corn? and the Sabbath that we may ſet forth wheate?</hi> Amos 8. 5.

Thou knoweſt no more of Sabbath <note place="margin">Sabbatum aſinorum.</note> almoſt than the Oxe and the Aſſe, that reſteth from his labour. Thou maieſt not work on
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170336:104"/> this day, and yet thou wilt not mind thy ſoul. Thou maieſt not trade in the world, and yet thou wilt not traffick to Heaven. Oh, will it not be terrible to think that thou haſt had ſo many Subbaths, and yet haſt no ſanctity; that thou haſt had ſo many hallowed daies, and yet haſt no holineſſe; That thou hadſt rather ſleep, and paſſe away theſe daies with oſcitancy, and careleſſeneſſe, than ſtrive to enter in at the ſtreight gate of grace. Thus this opponent is anſwered, and this excuſe, if weighed in the ſanctuarie ballances, will be found too light. Thou haſt had time more than thou haſt known what to do withall.</p>

The day of your life hath been not a Winter's, but a Summer's day: You have followed many of your relations, and acquaintance to the grave, who have been younger than you, but you live ſtill. The Lord hath made you a long leaſe, and it is not yet expired.

And yet thou haſt brought forth no

The Lord hath added years to thy daies, as he did to <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> but thou haſt <note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 6.</note> not yet added ſanctity to thy civility, nor pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the power to thy profeſſion in the forme. Thou art well ſtricken in years, but thou haſt never yet fully ſtricken a Covenant with the Lord. Thou art entred a great way into the ſcores, but wouldeſt never yet enter cordially into the School of Chriſt. The Lord hath cut off many in their ſins, while they have been acting unrighteouſneſſe; as the drunkard that ſaid, he ſhould never die, yet fell down a pair of ſtaires preſently, and died: while you have eſcaped, and your life hath been given you for a prey; and yet all this while you have gotten no grace. You have ſeen of the fruit of your body it may be to the third generation, and yet the Lord hath ſeen no fruits of grace from your ſoul: you have been fruitful according to the fleſh, but barren according to the ſpirit. You have lived ſo long as to have an hoary head, but not ſo long as to have an holy heart. Hath the Lord lengthened out your daies to a longer date, than the daies of many of your ſtock and Family, and yet are you without
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170336:110"/> grace? Are you ancient in years, and yet have not come in, to the ancient of dayes? Is invaluable time of no value with you?

                  <p>Ah poor ſoul, is it not a very great evil that the Lord hath been laying ſiege to thine heart, theſe thirty, fourty, fifty years, or more, and yet thou haſt ſtood up, and ſtouted it out againſt him; that thou haſt ſo long been called by him, and yet thy deaf vile heart hath not hearkned
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170336:110"/> to him, nor cloſed with him; length of time o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomes many things, but thou haſt been lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <note place="margin">Nihil eſt, quod lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginquitas temporis efficere non poſſit.</note> the better for thy long time. There hath been an extenſion of thy daies, but no intenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy deſires; a lengthening of thy ſeaſon, but no loathing of thy ſins.</p>
                  <p>6. The latitude of your comforts: Your <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">S. </seg>15</label> daies have had breadth as well as length: Your daies have been fair, not foul; clear, not clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; delightful with Sun-ſhine, not darkned with ſadneſſe; ſome have had a continued, but not a comfortable life; ſome have lived many years, and may ſay with <hi>David, My life is ſpent with griefe, and my years with ſighing.</hi> Pſal. 31. 10. Have lived all their daies, and it may be not ſeen the Sun, when it may be, it was never hid from thee. The Lord hath watered your <note place="margin">Praeſentis vitae pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitas aliquando idcirco datur, ut ad melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem vitam provocet.</note> long life with the ſhowers of comfort, that it hath flouriſhed; and yet for all this you have not been found in his wayes; others have been ſtreightned by poverty, when you have been enlarged by plenty; others have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with miſery, when you have been over-flowed with mercy; the condition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hath been very ſickly, while your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution hath been very healthy: You have hardly had a day of ſickneſſe, while others have had dayes of nothing but languiſhing ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; others have been made (with <hi>Job) To poſſeſſe moneths of vanity, and weariſome nights are appointed to them,</hi> that when they lie down they ſay, <hi>When ſhall I ariſe, and the night be gone? and I am full of toſſings to and fro, untill the dawning of the day:</hi> But thou haſt had <note place="margin">

                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:170336:111"/> moneths of liberty, and years of proſperity; and yet with the Halcyon, thou haſt not bred in ſuch calm weather; nor bloſſomed as the Roſe in this warm Sun-ſhine. The Lord hath hedged thee in with his favour, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thee about with fatneſſe, and yet thou haſt not been his ſervant: You have not felt of the calamities, nor hardly taſted of the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, that others have drank bitter draughts of, and yet you are never the nearer compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Lord: Have you known of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but proſperity almoſt, and yet will you know nothing of true piety. Hath that driven you from God, that ſhould have drawn you to God? Hath your habitation ſtood toward the Sun, and yet hath not your heart ſtood toward Zion? You have enjoyed a Paradiſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, (not but that you have met with <note place="margin">Deus feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citatibus terrenis amaritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet.</note> ſome croſſes, for that is a very clear day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there comes no cloud between the Sun and our ſight:) But in compariſon of others, you have lived as it were in <hi>Eden;</hi> and yet have you not hearkened to the voice of the Lord walking in the midſt of the Garden in the cool of the day? Have you had ſuch a circumfluence of outward peace, and no circumciſion of your inward parts? Sickneſſe is a burden you ſay, and that hindreth, and maketh you unfit for any good; and it ſeems health doth not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you in ſpiritual things. Want is a woeful thing, you ſay, and diſtracts you that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not look after grace, and it ſeems wealth doth the ſame too, as you order the matter. Hath not your tranquillity, I ſay, your aged tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170336:111"/> invited you to hearken to the calls of Heaven? Hath the Lord cut the wings of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, that it might not flie from you all your dayes, and have you clipped, or clogged the wings of your affections and deſires, that you might not flie into the boſome of Chriſt? Hath the Lord cauſed peace, and priviledges, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and temporal contentments to be your houſhold gueſſe, and to lodge with you all night, and yet will you refuſe to make the Lord Chriſt welcome to your heart? hath the Lord enlarged thy borders, and filled thee with the flower of wheat, and yet hath not thine eare been open to his call? Hath the candle of the Lord ſhined upon thine head all thy daies? <hi>Haſt thou waſhed thy ſteps with butter, and hath the</hi>

Thine head hath been crowned with Roſe buds all thy daies, but thou haſt not been willing that thy heart ſhould be crowned with grace. Upon all theſe conſiderations you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, are not able to ſay, that you are not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but muſt rather ſay, you are notoriouſly guilty: after all theſe means not to be mended, after all theſe allurements not to be altered; to make ſturdy oppoſition, when thou haſt no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient objections, maketh your ſin great, and grievous, and raiſeth it beyond the ordinary pitch.</p>
                  <p>To contemne grace after all God's counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancings,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170336:112"/> to continue in rebellion after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny calls to repentance doth exceedingly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate your fault.</p>
                  <p>2. Adminiſtring cauſes: In the next place <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">S. </seg>16</label> let us inquire into the cauſe of theſe carriages; for it may ſeem a wonder, that any ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect ſo great a work; there muſt be ſomething more then ordinary in it, that overtures of grace, ſhould be ſo overly dealt withal. If we ſearch, we ſhall find there is a root of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe that produceth this fruit; and if we find the cauſe, there is ſome hopes of a cure; for who having found the cauſes would not, (if in their right minds) have them pulled <note place="margin">Sublatâ cauſâ tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litur effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus.</note> up by the roots; and if the foundation fall, the building cannot ſtand.</p>
                  <p>Now the cauſes, why people no more mind, and look after effectual calling then they do, are theſe.</p>

                  <p>1. Not right apprehenſions: People have <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">S. </seg>17</label> not thoſe clear thoughts of things, as they
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170336:112"/> ſhould have. An errour in Theory muſt needs produce an errour in practicks. An errour in the head will ſoon bring an errour into the heart. Wrong apprehenſions are not like to have right actions. The underſtanding is the leading faculty, and if that be out of frame, no wonder if the reſt move not in their ſpheare. As our judgements are of things, ſo are our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours about them more, or leſſe: We ſhall begin with the firſt thing where about their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions are not right.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of the nature of effectual calling: Here <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">S. </seg>18</label> they are out, and quite beſides the cuſhion. The moſt of people are in an errour concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this thing; and the moſt that they have are ſome ſcattered notions, but no diſtinct and ſpecial conceptions of it; ſome common thoughts, but not the centain truth.</p>
                  <p>They may happily underſtand it according to the Letter (though many come not thus far) but not according to the ſpirit: they take it to be that, which it is not; but they take it not to be that which it is. <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> though <note place="margin">
                        <hi>John</hi> 3. 4.</note> a chief man, yet was but a Child in this thing. That which was ſpoken ſpiritually, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood carnally. Chriſt laid before him that which was right, and he looks upon it as a rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, yea as ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>The moſt uſeful things are moſt unknown, <note place="margin">Multa ſcienda neſciuntur</note> and the moſt needleſſe moſt known; and if people have not right apprehenſions of effectual calling, how can they have zealous affections for it? unſeen things are unſought. In the confuſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> they underſtood not one <note place="margin">Ignoti nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la cupido.</note>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:170336:113"/> another; ſo by the fall of man came ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion upon the underſtanding that people know not the language of the Lord; and when he calls for repentance, converſion, and bids them <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 31.</note> make them new hearts, they know not what theſe things mean.</p>
                  <p>They take this work to be a Star of the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer magnitude, when it is a Star of the greater magnitude. The Lord calls for the heart, <hi>My Son, give me thine heart.</hi> Prov. 23. 26. And ſuch are peoples miſconceits, that they give him the hand.</p>
                  <p>The Lord calls for the power, and they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking give him the forme. The Lord calleth for ſincerity in the inward parts, and they give him conformity in the outward profeſſion. The Lord calls for the conſcience within, and they give him nothing but compliance without. They know not the nature of it. They do not rightly conceive the parts and properties, the dignity, and excellency thereof. They think there is ſuch a thing, but wherein the formality of it conſiſteth, they do not apprehend, for they are carnal, and natural. Now the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man as he receiveth not, ſo neither doth he perceive the things of God: for they are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14.</note> diſcerned.</p>
                  <p>They are many ſtrains above the reach of his capacity, above the touch of his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Hence it is that they ſet not upon this work, when called to it; and that they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way without practice, when ſuch things are preached unto them. Hence, when exhorted to it, they know not how to enter upon it; and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170336:113"/> when adviſed, they know not how to addreſſe themſelves to it; miſunderſtanding of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject muſt needs marre the undertaking of the ſubject; nor will this be any excuſation, but rather an accuſation of them, becauſe this and <note place="margin">Mala vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate unuſ quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que miſer efficitur.</note> the reſt of the evil crew that follow, ſpring chiefly, and principally from the will: for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple neither know, nor will know. They love to be Children in ſuch things, and care not for the eſtate of man-hood, wherein childiſh things ſhould be put away. Turn them to the theſe things, and they have hardly a Primmer knowledge of them. In other things, what a deal of capacity in the conceiving of them? and therefore a deal of dexterity in the acting them: but here how ſhallow, low, and mean are peoples thoughts? Their eyes are blinded, their minds obſcured; and yet it is ſtrange that people ſhould be in the dark, when preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant light ſhines upon them. Though people have theſe things opened, and unfolded to them, yet that they ſhould not ſee into the nature of them, is very ſad. That the Doctrine of effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling, or repentance from dead works, (for they are all one) which is an element and principle of piety, and therefore put into the Chriſtians Catechiſme by the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ſhould be ſo little known, though of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. 2.</note> conned; ſo little ſeated in the head, though ſo often ſaid by heart, is matter of admiration. This is the great Remora, and let in the way. Till they get over this ſtile, they cannot come into the field of grace. Till you know the meaning of this work truely, you cannot
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170336:114"/> expect to be mended throughly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of the need of calling: People have not <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">S. </seg>19</label> right apprehenſions of the need of this work of effectual calling; and hence alſo it comes to paſſe that they are no more careful about it, nor deſirous that it paſſe upon them: where the neceſſity of any thing is not ſeriouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, there actual endeavours will never be ſuitably extended.</p>
                  <p>Great is the force of need, and the ſence thereof, to ſet the heart on deſiring, and the hand on doing; and he that knows his need of any thing which he conceives to be of weight and moment, will through fire and water for the attainment thereof: neceſſity will take no denial, and knows how to object againſt all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, and put-offs. But though a thing were of never ſo great excellency and utility, that it were the marrow of their comforts, the life of their ſouls, yea the key of Heaven, yet if their eye were not opened to ſee this their deſires and endeavours would keep their hands in their boſome, and never put forth themſelves to do ought. Now how needful is effectual calling, and a ſanctifying and ſaving change upon the whole man? If we look upon it as the mind of God, as a mean to Heaven, we <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Neceſſitas praecepti, &amp; medij. Luk.</hi> 10 42</note> ſhall ſee it is needful: as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> ſo may we of this, <hi>One thing is needful, viz.</hi> to hearken to, and obey the call of Chriſt. It is needful for people, if they would be ſaved, and who will not profeſſe deſires that way? If they would have a throne in glory, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. If they would live for ever, if they would
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170336:114"/> eſcape everlaſting burnings, it is needful. But people are as careleſſe hereof, as if either there were no God, no Heaven, no Hell, or as if they had found out ſome other paſſage to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſo long as people's need is unknown, ſo long their negligence will be uncured; ſo long as people think they are ſafe without it, ſo long they will never be careful to be ſaved with it; and ſo long as they think they are well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, they will not readily have a will unto it. It is ſtrange that they ſhould not know how needful it is, which is ſuperlatively needful. It is ſo needful poor ſoul, that unleſſe thou be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called, thou muſt be eternally curſed; ſo needful, that if thou be not changed, thou canſt never poſſibly be crowned; that if thou be not cleanſed, thou ſhalt never be glorified; that if thou be not ſanctified, thou canſt never be ſaved. By nature thou art an enemy to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21.</note> God in thy mind by wicked works, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be renewed, or thou canſt never walk <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Amos</hi> 3, 3.</note> with God in the ſtreets of the new <hi>Jeruſalem. For can two walk together, except they be agreed.</hi> Be thou what, or who thou wilt be, if thou be not drawn to God by grace, thou wilt be damned in Hell. If thou wert the Son of my Mother, or the fruit of mine own body, I muſt tell thee, that if this work be not done, and paſſe upon thee, thou muſt needs be undone, and periſh for ever.</p>
                  <p>If thou wert as potent as <hi>Alexander,</hi> as rich as <hi>Croeſus,</hi> as ſubtle as <hi>Achitophel,</hi> as beautiful as <hi>Abſalom,</hi> as ſtrong as <hi>Sampſon,</hi> yet without this paſſe-port thou canſt not be pardoned, nor
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170336:115"/> partaker of glory; ſo indiſpenſably, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary is this work, that we may ſay <note place="margin">Non aqua, non igni, non aere pluribus locis uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, quam amicitia.</note> of it more then the Heathen Oratour ſaid of friendſhip; water, fire, and aire are needful, but this more. Friendſhip and amity with God is moſt neceſſary; yea, it is before meat and drink, for we may live here without them, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Man liveth not by bread alone,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Senſus est, homines non vivere ex ſolis cauſis phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicis, quum Deus non ſit illis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictus, Bez. in loc.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God:</hi> For God is not tied up to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſes: but we cannot live hereafter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this; for <hi>without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Heb. 12. 14. It is one of the firſt ſteps of that Ladder, which reacheth to Heaven, and unleſſe here thou firſt ſet footing, there is no climbing the tree of life. If you cannot produce new hearts, my dear Friend, and Chriſtian Reader, you ſhall never poſſeſſe the new Heavens. If you have not this work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſouls, you can neither do, nor have, that which a Saint ſhould do, and have: You cannot live to God, nor upon God, nor with God, unleſſe you live from God; what though it do not purchaſe Heaven? yet it prepares for it; what though Heaven be not the deſerved wages of grace, yet grace is the deſireable way to Heaven. Oh, ſad it is, that you ſhould not know the need of it. <hi>Tiberius Caeſar</hi> ſaid it was a ſhame that men of ſixty years of age ſhould reach out their hand to the Phyſitian to have their pulſe felt, becauſe they ſhould not be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the temper of their body themſelves; what a ſhame is it for men and women, to live many years in the School of Chriſt, and to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170336:115"/> know ſo little of the need of grace, which is there conſtantly preached, and preſſed? what <note place="margin">Ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia ſui ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium omnis peccati.</note> a ſhame for men and women of yeers to have ſo little cognizanee of their own condition, ſo little acquaintance with their own eſtate, ſo little knowledge of their ſouls concernments, as not rightly to apprehend the need of a change? where almoſt is the man or woman, that is truly ſenſible of the need of a new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? How hard a work is it to convince them thereof? to work it into their heads, to ſink it into their hearts? Did any that were bodily ſick look after Chriſt, when he was on earth, for a cure, but thoſe that perceived their need thereof? and we are ſoon brought to a ſenſe of temporal miſeries, and by that to a ſight of the need of a medicine: but in ſpirituals (through ſtupefaction) we feel no pains, and hence it is we care for no plaiſter; or if people have ſome ſenſe of the need of this work, yet it is ſo faint and ſlighty, that it makes them not fervent in ſeeking after, and ſuing for it: They have ſuperficial thoughts that the thing may be good and commendable, and it is well for them that are in ſuch an eſtate; but as for permanent and powerful thoughts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they have none: They have not ſuch thoughts as the Apoſtle had in another caſe of great moment; <hi>A neceſſity is laid upon me, yea, and wo be unto me if I preach not the Goſpel.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16.</note> So they cannot ſay, a neceſſity is laid upon my ſoul, yea, and wo be unto me if I be not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called: Soul, thou doſt not conſider, that without this <hi>Benjamin,</hi> (this child of God's
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170336:116"/> right hand) thou canſt never ſee his face; and that unleſſe thou be regenerated and born again, thou canſt not enter into the Kingdom <note place="margin">

If here you have not the communication of the Spirit's grace, you cannot have hereafter the participation of its glory; if the whole world ſhould be laid down as a pawn for you, it would not prevail: The Angels in Heaven, that are without ſpot, cannot ſtead you without this. Ah, if you did but know how needful it were, you would grieve in ſpirit, you would long and labour, you would ſigh and ſeek for it, and find no reſt in your ſpirit neither day nor night, till God had turned your night into day, you ſin into ſanctity; you would never be quiet till you were ſpiritually quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and would find no true contentation <note place="margin">Corporis converſio, ſi ſola fuerit, erit nulla.</note> in your mind, till you had a total renovation of the whole man; yea, you would ſay, Lord, give me grace, a new nature, at what rate ſoever, though it coſt me all I have: Thou mayſt buy gold too dear, but thou canſt not buy grace too dear; you would give all that you might have this gift beſtowed upon you; you would be importunate with the Lord, and take no nay, till you were called home into his boſome, if you did but know the neceſſity of this work.</p>

People think that profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and profeſſion of Chriſt are of equal extent, they think that all that have the word of grace in their eare, have the work of grace on their heart; that all are Iſrael, that are of Iſrael; that all that have the name of a Chriſtian, have the nature <note place="margin">

There are many that are the people of God, who yet have no part in God: Thoſe that are effectually called are but a few, as a remnant left of the whole piece; as a garden plot in compariſon of the whole world. In all ages they have been but few that have received the ſpirit to the renewing of their hearts: The garland of grace is not ſet upon the head of every one. It is a rare thing to be gracions, and they are rare perſons that are ſo. The heavenly ſeed, though it be ſown thick, yet it comes up but thin; we muſt beat many trees to gather a buſhel of ſuch fruit; and ſearch many Towns to find a little company that truly fear the name of the Lord. Where we conceive things to be of a more common and univerſal nature, we are eaſily induced to think we have, or ſoon may have a right and propriety in them; but where we think they are ſingular and ſeldome, it is more difficult to raiſe ſuch concluſions, and renders us more diligent in the conſtant proſecution of them.

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170336:118"/> ſchool, will ſhut up their book, and away to play. High conceits of preſent attainments are great obſtructers to future atchievements. Thoſe that are whole, though but in their own thoughts, will never care for the Phyſitians druggs: men think it loſt labour to beſtow ſo much as a wiſh upon that which they think they have already. This hath ſtaved off many an one from Chriſt; this ſnare hath entangled many an one, that they could not goe a ſtep further: yet this is the courſe of the world, and moſt are delighted to be carried with this ſmooth ſtream: They love guilded ſhadows, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then they love golden ſubſtances: There are too many that make themſelves rich, when yet they have nothing.

Oh! dear friends, if you think your condition good, when it is not, you are in the high way to deſtruction; you have wind and tide, and oare, to ſpeed your voyage to the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone.

The Lord ſaveth none in their ſins; but ſaved from your ſins you may be. To fancie ſuch mercy, is but <note place="margin">In omni opere Dei est miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordia et juſtitia.</note> to fall down to an Idol; for mercy and juſtice meet together: the riſing of one attribute is not built upon the ruine of another. God is full of pity thou thinkeſt, that he will ſpare thee though thou be never ſo full of impietie; and therefore you ſend not forth ſo much as one thought to look after grace: He that made you will not damn you, he that formed you, will not confound you for your ſinnes, you think: Doe but conſult that ſtartling place in <hi>Eſay. It is a people of no underſtanding, therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them; and he that formed them, will ſhew them no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> Eſa. 27. 11. Gods mercie you ſee, will not advance you to happineſſe, if you live,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170336:120"/> and die without holineſs: By ſuch thoughts you make mercy a means to ſink you, which otherwiſe might be a means to ſave you: what is this but to turn the grace of God into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs? Be not deceived, God will not be mocked: the Lords mercy glorifieth in heaven onely thoſe whom he ſanctifieth on earth.</p>
                  <p>Though God be mercifull, yet you will be miſerable without grace; preſumption of Gods favour, without a change on your heart, will prove the confuſion of your face: and if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his compaſſion you diſobey the call of his Spirit, you are like to meet with nothing but condemnation: let mercie be a motive to draw you to contrition, and not a means to drown you in perdition. Every one, though their hearts be fraughted with nothing but ſin, yet they would caſt anchor in the mercy of God, that they might be ſaved from tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting tempeſts, and ſo long as they think they ſhall have glory, let who ſo will look after grace: if they may be ſaved through Gods mercy, what need they care for Chriſts Spirit? but ſoul, know thus much, that though Gods mercy have neither bottom nor bank, yet it will not benefit you in reference to glory, if you come into, and goe out of the world a ſinfull wretch: Thoſe that confide in Gods mercy againſt Gods method, are like to have a ſad come off, when it comes to the upſhot.</p>

So the Lord by his Miniſters and Spirit, asketh people when they will marry, &amp; be eſpouſed to Jeſus Chriſt; they ſay, It is too ſoon; they have good deſires to Chriſt, but they would ſtay yet a while; the Lord in patience waits and comes to them with the ſame query afterwards, and then they ſay, It is too late; nature is decayed, their ſpirits are ſpent; but they will wiſh well, and they would have God accept of that: moſt put of all to the laſt, and yet then they are as unfit and unwilling as ever; and God in juſtice rejects them who injuriouſly
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170336:121"/> refuſed him. People are like little children, who loathe to have their play ſpoiled or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by wet weather, ſay, Rain, rain, go away, come again another day. Sinners have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times convictions, that they begin to melt and be ſorrowful; and the heavenly doctrine falls upon them in ſuch drops, that it begins to wet them, to damp their ſport, to dull their joy, and they bid it go away, and if it come in old age it ſhall be welcome; and put away the meſſages of God, the calls of the ſpirit, and ſay, as <hi>Felix</hi> to <hi>Paul, When I have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient</hi>

                  <p>To defer in this caſe is to deny; to procra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, is but to prevaricate. He that refuſeth to hearken now, it is to be feared he will hearken never.

It is one of Satan's policies to make you drive off this work, which in effect is no other then to drive away the worker, <hi>viz.</hi> the Holy Ghoſt; and one of his fallacies to ſuggeſt to you, that ſo the work be done, all is well; and that it may be as well done hereafter as for the preſent; whereas the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith the contrary, <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts,</hi> Heb. 3. 7, 8.</p>

They are like Duke <hi>D' Alva,</hi> who when the King his Maſter asked him, if he had ſeen the Eclipſe, anſwered, he had ſo much to do on earth, that he had no leiſure to look up to heaven; ſo much do they converſe with the creature, that they know not how to convert to the Creator: And ſo they can but furniſh the body, it matters not with them, though they forget their ſouls; they ſtoop to take up theſe golden apples, and in the mean time loſe the prize of grace; they are loth to come out of the warm Sun-ſhine into God's bleſſing; there is ſuch a croud of worldly thoughts and intentions about the heart, that grace canot get neer the door with its motions; they followtheſe things with ſuch ſpeed, that when they ſhould look after grace, alas! their ſpirits are ſpent. It is juſt that they ſhould go away without the pearl, who ſpend their time in getting pebbles; and that they ſhould be deprived of the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting ſpirit, who devote themſelves to the <note place="margin">Fallax est hic mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</note> deceiving world; for when your out-ſide thrives upon its treacherous bounty, you will but ſtarve at heart for want of grace: yet this is the courſe and cuſtome of people, to loſe treaſures for looking after trifles, and to put <note place="margin">

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170336:122"/> farms; Chriſt calleth them in the Miniſtry of the word to grace, to ſanctity, to an upright walking, to the renovation of their ſouls; they deſire to be excuſed however a while, they would fain have a little more delight, fain reach to ſuch an eſtate, fain diſpatch ſuch a buſineſſe, they cannot yet tend to ſuch things; people are ſo buried in ſenſual things, that they know not how to look after a ſpiritual life: Theſe things ſo ſwallow up their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that better things can find no accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with them: Theſe do ſo monopolize and ingroſſe their time and thoughts, that the Spirit's motions can find no entertainment with them. Ah, vain man, are pleaſure and profit ſuch darlings, that your ſoul and grace are the leſſe dear to you? Will not you repent it when it is too late? <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> yielded up his Army, and whole power into the enemies hands, for a little water to quench his and their thirſt; and when he had ſo done, then cried out, What have I loſt for a little drink? It will be ſad, when thou ſhalt be forced to complain another day, and ſay, What have I loſt, my God for gold? my ſoul for ſin? piety for profit? grace for gain? wiſedom for wealth? goodneſſe for greatneſſe?

They do not hide that ſeed in the furrows of their heart, which is ſown by the Miniſters hand: The not heeding the word, is a great cauſe of not having the work: The word not pondered in the mind, is unlike to be a means of purifying the man; many think <note place="margin">Verba Dei quae aure percipitis, mente re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinete.</note> it enough to give it the hearing, though they refuſe it entertainment: Hearing without heeding, will bring little good to the ſoul.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170336:123"/> People many times give as little regard to the truth as to a tale: The word is the means of effectual calling, &amp; if that be not minded, it is like to have little effect upon a man or woman. The word is to be heard with both ears; when people hear, they do not hear as if it were for their life; they conſider not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of what is ſpoken, nor the ſpecial reference it hath to them. They are not careful that nothing fall to the ground of that which falleth from heaven. It is ſaid of <hi>Lydia,</hi> that ſhe heard, <note place="margin">

But people when they hear things of concernment, look upon them as cuſtomary; many things of weight and worth are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them, which they ſlightly run over and do not ruminate; this is the great cauſe of their ſpiritual uncleanneſſe, becauſe they chew not the cud. There muſt be attention without avocation; conſcionable, careful hearers reach to ſomething, when others, ſive-like, let out as much, and as oft as let in. People are told of their condition, which did they conſider, they would look after a reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: They hear the nature of ſin, the news of a Saviour; of the quality of grace, the neceſſity of Chriſt; which were they more often in their ſerious meditation, there were ſome more hopes of their ſpiritual mutation.

They do not gather up, nor call in their ſpirits and affections, and center <note place="margin">Hoc age.</note> them upon the buſineſs in hand: and to this purpoſe doth the Lord complain of his people under <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Miniſtry, that they did afford <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31.</note> a perſonal appearance, but did not accord to a ſpiritual attendance; that they did hear the word, but did not heart it; for their heart was truanting abroad after their covetouſneſs, while they tasked their bodies to an outward correſpondency. People give no diligent heed, and hence it is that they have no dutiful hearts: <note place="margin">Quid vobis plus eſſe videtur verbum Dei, aut corpus Chriſti? Non minus est reus, qui verbu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dei neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligenter audiverit, quam ille qui corpus Chriſti, in terra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentia ſua cadere permiſit.</note> They hear only for faſhion, and not to be faſhioned by the word; otherwiſe they would hear, not only with their heads, but alſo with their hearts. The words of the Lord are no common words, no ordinary ſayings, that they ſhould be ſo much ſlighted: It is a great offence to God, and a great obſtacle to our ſouls good, not carefully to mind what is propounded; for it is delivered to us and to our uſe, and by this means it becomes uſeleſſe. This hath been the marring of many an ones ſoul, becauſe they have minded the word no more, hearing more for complement, than for converſion; for cuſtome, than for conſcience: If thou go on in this negligent careleſſe way of hearing wherein thou art, thou art not like to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted;

The word not heeded will little help thee; it argueth a fatal dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of peoples ſpirits, that they ſhould fancy health from the hearing of the word, when they are not watchful in waiting upon it: It ſheweth that deluſions prevail far upon them, that they can think to be ſaved by that which they do not ſavour; to be ſavingly converted by that which they do not ſeriouſly conſider.

Thoſe that are moſt wiſe for temporals, are many times moſt fools for ſpirituals; and though one would be willing to take their counſel for the one, yet loath to follow their courſe for the other.

Thoſe that will ſwim with the world, muſt accuſe themſelves if they ſink with the world. To pin our faith upon other mens ſleeves, is to pinion our wings, and hinder us in our flight to heaven.

Who in their right minds but would account it a very cheap pennyworth, if they could purchaſe the knowledge of election, though with the expenſe of the world? which none can have but the holy, none can reach but the renewed. None can conclude they are in God's roll, but thoſe that walk according to God's rule. None can conclude they are predeſtinated, but they that are purified.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">S. </seg>4</label> have perſwaſions of comfort, they are uſually from the ſpirit, and are right. The wicked perſwade themſelves that they are alive to God, that they are beloved of God, but ſuch perſwaſions are but falſe fires; and they do only in their dream ſay, Aha, I am warm, I have ſeen the fire: They lull their ſpirits aſleep with <hi>Siren</hi> ſongs; and their perſwaſions
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170336:133"/> are no other than Satans deluſions, and their ſouls deſtruction. Full and compleat comfort thou canſt not expect, who art in an eſtate of grace; for while in this valley, thou art never like to ſee the clear face of the Sun of comfort without a ſhowre, ſuch happineſſe being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the upper region of glory, which is free from theſe changes. Here hope and deſpair keep viciſſitudes, and alternate courſe: But when this Sun ſhines upon thine head, thou mayſt have cauſe to think it is the Spirit's <note place="margin">

The Spirit's comfortable perſwaſions, and gracious operations he links together: not but that God's people may conclude comfort upon a falſe ground. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the matter of the concluſion is firm, though the manner be not in form; and when they have ſecret intimations, and ſpecial ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the pardon of their ſins, of their part in the. Covenant, it is true as a propoſition, though not as a concluſion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch things do belong only to ſuch as are good. They may weakly conclude ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, but they do not wickedly conclude: what an happineſſe now is that for a man or woman to be in ſuch a condition, wherein, if they have ſuppoſitions of divine acceptation, they do not miſſe the mark, when others do no leſſe than hazard their ſouls by ſuch thoughts. If thou ſay thy ſins are pardoned, the Spirit will own thee in it, and add the reſponſal, and ſay, thine iniquities ſhall be
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170336:134"/> remembred no more. To have right per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions is a great mercy, to have wrong is a great miſery; if you think God's countenance is upon you, his covenant towards you, your thoughts agree with the thing. Due perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of comfort are the peculiar portion of the Saints.</p>

Saints are one with Chriſt, not by identification, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction; not by commutation of ſubſtance, but by application of faith; not by material commixion, but by myſterious copulation; for duſt and aſhes to be united to an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Mediator is a great matter. Believer, Chriſt hath not only united thy perſon to himſelf hypoſtatically, but thy nature alſo myſtically. The neereſt and ſtrongeſt rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on earth are made uſe of as emblems to ſhadow out the noble conjunction between a Chriſtian and his Chriſt in heaven. When you were effectually called, you were called into the lap, boſome, and heart of Chriſt. You were called to be girt to him with the girdle of faith, faſtened with the knot of trueſt and indiſſoluble love; Chriſt is in thee, and thou art in Chriſt. Chriſt and others are as far aſunder as Eaſt from Weſt, and North from
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170336:134"/> South, whereas thou and Chriſt art as neer as may be. Thoſe muſt needs be ſafe, that are ſo neer to Chriſt; and muſt needs laſt as long as Chriſt. Thou art alſo partner with Chriſt; as himſelf, ſo all that is his is thine: <hi>By whom ye were called unto the fellowſhip of his Son</hi>

                     <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Thoſe that are converted to Chriſt, are confederates with Chriſt: thoſe that are found in him, have fellowſhip with him; when Chriſt joyns ſouls to himſelf in a ſpiritual marriage, he makes them a fair joynture of his whole eſtate. He gives for a dowry to his Spouſe, no leſſe than a part in his whole poſſeſſion. Where there is purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Chriſt's ſpirit, there is participation of Chriſt's merit; and can the world afford a portion anſwerable to this? What wouldſt thou, what canſt thou have more than this? Believing, beloved ſoul, know what thy ſtate and thy priviledge is, that thou mayſt rejoyce in the Lord, and that the joy of the Lord may be thy ſtrength. Can you think of this and not triumph? can you have this in ſerious meditation, and not be raiſed with joyful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration? If joy and comfort belong to any, <note place="margin">Est gaudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, quod non datur impiis, ſed eis, qui te gratis colunt.</note> then certainly to the Saints; and if upon any, then upon this account of their union with and intereſt in Chriſt. Surely it cannot but make thee ſtrain the ſtrings one note higher in thy ſpiritual muſick, to think of this. There is a precious Pearl called an Union: This union with Chriſt is no doubt a Pearl of great price; better than any that ever yet adorned the head of greateſt Princes. It is
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170336:135"/> the choice flower in your ſpiritual garland; the gloriouſeſt feather in all your plume. It is ſuch a dignity, that but a few attain unto. The name of union is ſweet, the nature of it is advantagious, of what nature ſoever it be, whether natural, civil, &amp;c. It is the ſupporter and the ſafety of people and places: What then is union with Jeſus Chriſt? fellowſhip with the Son, and by him with the Father? Therefore comfort thy ſelf with this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, thou converted ſoul.</p>

To be <note place="margin">Si vis eſſe beatus, eſto im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> made a new creature is the bleſſing of bleſſings.

Some think bleſſedneſſe is to be found in mines of riches, in moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of honour; others think to find it in the path of pleaſure, in the way of their own will. But it is the gracious perſon upon whoſe head
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170336:135"/> the Scripture ſets the crown of bleſſedneſſe: That ſaith not, that the parted, or potent, that the wiſe, or witty, that the rich, or riotous, but that the pious are bleſſed: that which all ſeek for thou haſt found; that which others would have but want, thou haſt and enjoyeſt in truth: would you have more then bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then real bleſſedneſs? Thou mayſt joy thy ſelf for thy happineſſe. The Angels in <note place="margin">

If no greater curſe than to be the Divels ſlave, than ſure no greater bleſſing then to be God's ſervant. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> accounted it his happineſſe that he was a ſubject of Chriſt, rather than that he was So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign of the Eaſt. Let your condition be what it will otherwiſe, the curſe is gone, the bleſſing is come to your door, to your boſome, if you be in an eſtate of grace.

Thou canſt not get up into the tree of life, and ſhake ſoul-ſatisfying fruit into thy boſome without this ladder. Thou canſt not attain to ſaving weal without this ſanctifying work. Thou canſt never get to the top of glory without the ſtaff of grace viruled with the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt. Thou canſt not be a loved Son, unleſſe thou be a living Saint; many fondly preſume, and think to commence and take the degree of glory <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> neglecting grace: but it is the path, the way thereto; ſuch as meet not with God in their heart, ſhall never meet with God in heaven. Thou that haſt grace, haſt that threed which will undoubtedly lead thee into the bowre of bliſſe. This compaſſe will
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170336:136"/> not fail thee, but bring thee to the port, where thou needeſt fear neither billow nor blaſt.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">S. </seg>9</label> ſuch a condition, that you can act and do ſomething for God. Now thou art indued with a ſpirit that is quick and active, like the higheſt element, that finds no reſt but in travel, nor contentment but in the painful labours of worthy actions. To do for the Creator is as great dignity almoſt as the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can attain to; to be inſtrumental to his glory, to be ſubſervient to his praiſe, is a great preferment. To be agent for God, to be factor for heaven, is a choice flower in a Saints garden, a chief diamond in his diademe. Now thou haſt a talent to trade for God with; ſuch a principle whereby thou canſt act ſome ſuitable part in his ſervice. The Apoſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeecheth the <hi>Epheſians</hi> that they <hi>would walk</hi>

                     <hi>worthy of the vocation wherewith they were called.</hi> Thoſe that have life, can do the works of living men and women for their living God. When we are ſick, then we think what we would do for God if we were well. Thou
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:170336:137"/> that haſt grace art ſpiritually well, and haſt ability from God to work the works of God. The wicked can neither think, ſpeak, nor do for God; when thou canſt do all theſe things, through that grace that God hath beſtowed upon thee. It is true nobility, and the only <note place="margin">Summa apud Deum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitas est, clarum eſſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutibus.</note> advancement of a man, or a woman, to be fruitful in good works and duties towards God. Thou haſt cauſe to account it thy glory, and thy crown of rejoycing, that thou haſt an heart or hand to move towards, or do ought for God. Thoſe that are in their ſins are dead, and can do nothing. Thou that art a Saint art alive, and canſt do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Thou canſt be a means to promote the glory, to predicate the greatneſs of the Lord. To be able to pray, read, hear, ſpeak, believe, oppoſe ſin, ſtand up in the behalf of grace, is more by far then to be endowed with talents and abilities for temporal and ſecular undertakings. One action done for God from grace, is of more worth then all the atchievements of the moſt eminent without grace. When <hi>David</hi> and his people offered freely to the building of the Temple, he was much affected and taken with it, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he and they were unworthy to be dignified with ability of doing thus for God, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 13, 14.</p>

If the Lord's heart had not been towards thee, he would never have drawn thy heart towards himſelf. Where the Lord hath been pleaſed to hang out this ſign of grace and a change, thou mayſt aſſure thy ſelf, there is ſtore of love in his boſome toward thee. The work of ſpiritual life in thee, is the fruit of God's working love to thee. Had not the Lord loved thee, he would never have done thus for thee: what cauſe of comfort then is there to thee, who haſt the love of God tranſcribed upon thy heart? gracious diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions flow from God's gracious affections; and thoſe to whom the Lord giveth ſaving and ſanctifying grace, are his <hi>Benjamins,</hi> his dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. Thoſe that can make out that they are in a living condition, may conclude God's loving inclination. If the Lord have changed thy nature, and renewed thy heart, thou mayſt look upon it as a love-token, with this poſey, or inſcription, <hi>I love thee freely.</hi> In theſe clear waters of grace, thou mayſt ſee the ſmiling ſerene face of heaven. In this book thou mayſt read whole Chapters of God's good will. And is it not a comforting cordial to know that one is in God's books, in his favour? Be glad and rejoyce, for the Lord loveth thee; one dram of God's ſpecial love is ſuch a pearl, that the whole world is not able to weigh

Thy calling is to have fellowſhip with Angels, communion with God, union to Chriſt. Thou art called to be one of the heavenly Court, a child of ſalvation, and an heir of happineſſe. There is no calling in the world comparable to thine; other are earthly callings, but this is an heavenly; they are to temporal good, but this to eternal grace; they to worldly accommodations, but this to worthy relations. Since God hath called thee to an eſtate of grace, he hath called thee to a better condition, than if he had ſet the beſt made tranſitory crown upon thine head. As thou art a man thy condition may be low, but as thou art a Saint it is lofty.

Set the flowre of your comfort in this pot of water, and it will not wither, but hold freſh a great while.

Parts and gifts are an outward grace to thoſe that have them, but they are not inward grace; you may know much of the word of God in the Scripture, and yet know none of the work of God in your heart.</p>

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:170336:141"/> and ſerious, but not ſanctified. One may have moral vertues without divine grace: <note place="margin">Splendida peccata.</note> moral goodneſſe is but ſplendid ſinfulneſſe: <hi>Paul</hi> was ſuch before converſion. Many are fair like the Moon, but without heat. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 19, 20. There was a fine young man to outward appearance; that had the letter, but not the life; good manners, but wanted a gracious mind. It is good to be ſo qualified, but it falls ſhort of the thing in queſtion. Many live juſtly, lovingly, prudently, courteouſly, who yet have no grace. There may be a fair life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a life of faith; civility without ſanctity; one may live according to common equity, and not be led by the rule of ſpecial piety; there may be moral vertue without, and yet maſterly vice within; there may be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable carriage, and yet no converting calling: there are many gentle, ſweet, tame natures, that never learned lowneſs and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility in Chriſt's ſchool.

                  <p>5. Not to be ſo great ſinners as others is not grace. Many if they be not theeves, drunkards, nor unclean perſons, think they have grace enough; whereas they ſin not as others do, it is from the goodneſſe of their conſtitution, rather than from the graciouſneſſe of their conſcience. But alas, it is not privative, but poſitive holineſſe, not comparative, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute that God looks for. People compare
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170336:141"/> themſelves with others, meaſure themſelves by <note place="margin">Non est bonit as, peſſimis eſſe melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem.</note> a falſe rule, and hence they think they are ell-wide, when they are not yard-wide: a man of an indifferent ſtature ſet by a lower man ſeemeth tall, but ſet by a taller is a dwarf: becauſe people are not ſo bad as they may be, it doth not follow that therefore they are ſo good as they ſhould be. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſaith in <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 10. not the tree that bringeth forth bad fruit, but that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down.

One that is but blear-eyed, is far before thoſe that are blind; yet he is in darkneſſe in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of thoſe that have their perfect ſight. When we compare our ſelves with the beſt, then we beſt ſee our own defects; when we compare our ſelves with the worſt, then we think we have overplus. To have a leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of badneſſe, a greater degree of goodneſſe than others, falls much ſhort of true grace; thou art not it may be ſcandalouſly vitious, and yet thou mayſt not be ſavingly vertuous. This is but the leaſt part of goodneſſe, if thou haſt no better evidence, thou needſt not open this at all: If thou keep in this way, and go no further, thou wilt never be acquainted with God's work.

                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:170336:142"/> calling. There is a Chriſtian in name, and a Chriſtian in nature; one may have the garb of a Chriſtian, and yet want the grace of a Chriſtian; there may be the paint without the parts of a Chriſtian; the faſhion without the frame. Many there are that are of a Chriſtian mind, and yet have no mind to Chriſt; that have a goodly profeſſion, but no godly converſation. More are Chriſt's followers then are his friends; and more will wear his <note place="margin">Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus nemo dicitur recte, niſi qui Chriſto moribus, prout valet, coaequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> coat and colours than care for his commands; they love his livery, but they are loth to lead his life. <hi>Paul</hi> diſtinguiſheth of <hi>Jews</hi> into out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28, 29. and ſo may we of Chriſtians. <hi>Paul</hi> was a profeſſor before converſion, but not a right practicer, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 5. Many Chriſtians there are, but, but a few that are Chriſt's; many Proteſtants, but a few Puritans; many are Chriſtians by calling, but few by changing; yet moſt think they are comely enough if they have but this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; and if they have but the habit of religion without, they care not for the heart of it within; they are all for the gloſſe, not regarding the text; and ſo they have but the outward facing, they feel no cold for want of the inward lining. Such are but the pictures of Chriſtians, and all that they have to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, is nothing but the gay clothing of outward conformity.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">S. </seg>10</label> I ſpeak of a Church in general: Be of what Church thou wilt, yet that doth not make thee gracious. Many if they can but get into the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:170336:142"/> community of the Church of God think all is well, though they have no ſociety with the God of the Church: you may be an impure member of a pure Church. I would not have any miſtake, and think that I go about to throw dirt in the faces of any Congregations. One that is Oxthodox and pious, may be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and yet never mended. Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, memberſhip, and priviledges are ſweet, but they are not grace; they are choice fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, but they are not ſaving faith; the Church door may be open to us, and in the mean time our hearts be ſhut to God. I would have none think priviledges are ſufficient without purity. <hi>Judas</hi> was one of Chriſt's Church and company. Thoſe that were of the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> were yet checked and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17.</note> chidden for their want of grace. It hath been a proverbial ſpeech, New <hi>England</hi> for ordinances, Old <hi>England</hi> for graces. If you lived in a Church of the ſtricteſt order, and higheſt attainments, yet it will not paſſe for the gold of grace. The Church is God's Seminary and Univerſity, and ſo are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches; but all that have their <note place="margin">Decor ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtit in interiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">S. </seg>12</label> grace, nor effectual calling. Many think that all is well, if they can but ſay and think that it is their conſcience. <hi>Paul</hi> was led by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, when he laſhed out againſt the truth, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 9. I thought I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jeſus of <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth;</hi> and yet then he was without grace: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may be blind, and know what follows if the blind lead the blind.

                     <hi>God, are the ſons of God.</hi> You may follow the teaching of conſcience, and yet have no truth of converſion: This is a great ſtarting hole in this age, and a great cover-fault. Blaſphemy and perſecution were the ways that <hi>Paul</hi>'s <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13.</note> conſcience walked him in; a wicked conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence cannot do well. If your conſcience be a rebel, it will not ſalve the matter, to ſay, you <note place="margin">Quid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiri pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur, ubi bona con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientia perditur.</note> followed your captain's command. One may ſteer their courſe by this card, and yet be no good Pilot; there may be a natural conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and yet no converſion of your nature. This is too weak a ground-fill to ſet the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of grace on; conſcience without the culture of heaven, will bring forth nothing but weeds; you may have confident perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the rectitude of your ways, and yet continue in the contumacious perverſeneſſe of your will.</p>
                  <p>10. To hold an opinion, or to adhere to this <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">S. </seg>13</label> or that party, is not grace. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> chides his <hi>Corinthians</hi> for their faction, that ſome would liſt themſelves under <hi>Paul</hi>'s colours, in oppoſition to <hi>Apollo;</hi> and others under <hi>Apollo</hi>'s colours, in oppoſition to <hi>Cephas,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. Some made it the great part of their religion, ſo to cry up works as to cry down faith; againſt whom <hi>Paul</hi> diſputeth in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans;</hi> others ſo to lift up ſaving faith, as to let down ſanctifying works; againſt whom <hi>James</hi> diſputeth in his Epiſtle. Creeds do not make Chriſtians; one may be of the perſwaſion of this, and the other party, and yet not be partakers of true piety; one
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:170336:144"/> may take up a new opinion, and yet not have a new heart. The Spider may faſten upon rich hangings, and yet be full of poyſon ſtill. Yet this is the faireſt copy, that many can produce to make out a title to the work of grace, becauſe they are in the ſame veſſel, upon the ſame ſtream with ſuch and ſuch a party: But I muſt tell thee, that though thou be a retainer to the camp of true Chriſtian ſouldiers, and holdeſt with the ſoundeſt ſide, yet that is not grace; godlineſs conſiſts in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful workings, not in parts taking.</p>
                  <p>11. The doing of all outward things, that <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">S. </seg>14</label> a true child of God may do, is not grace: for even ſo far ſometimes one may go that hath not grace. There may be hearing, praying, reading, conferring, alms-giving, faſting, &amp;c. and yet no grace; one that is in an eſtate of nature, may yet be ſo well mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the back of more common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that they may be able to keep pace with the godly a great way; and may be ſo ſuited alike outwardly, that you ſhall hardly know the one from the other: but the King's <note place="margin">Vita hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critae est quaedam viſio phantaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matis, quae hoc oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in imagine, quod non habet in veritate.</note> daughter hath a glory within, as well as gay clothing without. When Chriſt told his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that one of them ſhould betray him, there was none of them ſuſpected <hi>Judas,</hi> but ſaid, Lord, Is it I? You may be partners in the ſame ſhop of Chriſtianity with one that truly fears God, and act together, and yet you may be but a flaſh, a flouriſh; you may live a Saint, and die a ſinner; you may have the ſame external complexion, but not the ſame
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:170336:144"/> internal conſtitution; you may ſay your part word for word as well as another, and yet be no true proficient; you may have the ſame form, and yet not the ſame faith.</p>
                  <p>2. Now we come to ſpeak of thoſe things <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">S. </seg>15</label> that are more neerly related to effectual calling, that are more like unto it then the former, but are not it; for every like is not the ſame.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">S. </seg>16</label> no faith; there may be confeſſion of ſin, and yet no converſion to God; one may be brought ſo far as to acknowledge their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, and yet never come ſo neer as to be acquainted with true piety. Many confeſſe they have done ill, who are not careful to do well; there may be tongue-confeſſion without heart-contrition. <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I have ſinned:</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. One may have diſquiet and terror of <label type="milestone">

There are thoſe that have deep gaſhes in their conſciences, and yet do not bleed out their bad blood; there are that have been brought into grievous ſtraits, and yet were never brought into a gracious ſtate: There may be attrition where there is not <note place="margin">Attritio nullo modo potest fieri contritio.

Even wicked men may have undergone weariſome days and nights for their ſins; your conſcience hath been all on fire, and in a paſſion hath flown in your face; your bones have been broken, and anguiſh and horror hath ſiezed upon you for your ſins; you have roared through diſquietneſſe for your tranſgreſſions, and have laboured as in the very fire for your abominations; your heart hath been lanced it may be in every quarter; but put all together, and it amounts not to effectual calling. <hi>Judas</hi> was tormented in his mind, but never turned in his manners: It is ſaid he repented himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 3. the word <note place="margin">

Who is there that liveth never ſo ill, but would be willing to die well? If this were grace, we ſhould have a great harveſt of Saints. Heaven is the deſire of many, when hell is their deſert; moſt deſire the Saints paradiſe, when but few care for the Saints piety; many who proſecute their ſinful luſts, will yet earneſtly petition for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life; and would fain be triumphant, that care not for being militant; he is no right ſouldier that would wear the crown, but is loth to fight to win the field; deſires of heaven are <note place="margin">Non impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trat a deo bonum quod poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, qui ejus legi non obedit.</note> in vain, unleſs there be duty on earth.

But a godly ſoul is zealous, though to its diſadvantage: I will ſpeak of thy teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies alſo before Kings, and will not be aſhamed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 46.

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:170336:151"/> and when it deſires heaven, it is upon this account as much as any, becauſe it hopes it <note place="margin">Nunquam juſtus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitratur ſe compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendiſſe, nunquam dicit ſatis est.</note> ſhall be freed from its ſins, and ſhall not meet with the <hi>Cananite</hi> and <hi>Hittite</hi> in that land; it hath inſatiable deſires as it were after grace, and thirſteth exceedingly for theſe ſtreams; it accounteth holineſs its great happineſs, and its glory in heaven to conſiſt in conformity to God, as well as communion with God.</p>

It may be they bid ſome defiance to ſuch ſins as march in the head of the troop, but as for meaner ſins, that bring up the rear, they hold a confederacy and league with them; but as for the godly ſoul, it fighteth againſt a common ſouldier as well as a chief commander.</p>

If they can but keep them from running abroad in the action, they will give them good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment at home in the diſpoſition. An horſe may be reſtrained by the curb, and yet have a mind to be flinging and flying out. A water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe may be ſtayed by a bank, and yet have a propenſity to run over: even ſo it is with the wicked in reference to ſin; they lop the branch, but never look after the root; ſo they can but quench and damp the fire for the preſent, they care for no more; but the godly ſeek the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and plucking of ſin up by the roots; they ſeek not only to cut off the hand, but alſo
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:170336:156"/> to kill the heart of ſin. <hi>Mortifie therefore your members that are on earth,</hi> is the Apoſtle's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. The wicked ſnuff the candle, the godly extinguiſh and put it out: a godly ſoul vows the death and deſtruction of its ſins, and would have the heart blood of them, will give them no quarter.</p>
                  <p>2. Impartial proſecution. The ſoul that is <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">S. </seg>61</label> effectually called is impartial towards ſin; it doth not prize ſome, and part with others; it hath not a confederacy with ſome becauſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious, and a combat with others becauſe abominable; it doth not favour this becauſe attended by profit, nor frown on that becauſe allied to poverty; it doth not ſavour one ſin becauſe more ſweet, nor diſrelliſh another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe more ſowr; it is ſufficient it is ſin, it matters not with them what it can ſay for it ſelf: though conſtitution and cuſtome, gain and glory, profit and pleaſure, delight and dignity ſhould ſtand up as advocates, and plead in the behalf of ſuch and ſuch a ſin, yet its ears would be deaf to their inſinuating oratory; though it were the ſignet on its right hand, yet it would caſt it away; though it were their dear darling minion ſin, yet it would thruſt it out of doors. As <hi>Jephthah</hi> ſaid in another caſe, <hi>Whatſoever cometh</hi>

But this will not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man do; he may defie ſome ſins, and delight in others. <hi>Herod</hi> did ſpit out ſome evils, but his inceſt was too ſweet a morſel to be
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:170336:157"/> forced out of his mouth: a godly ſoul looketh upon ſin as ſin, and ſo comes to hate it with a perfect hatred. <hi>I hate every falſe way,</hi> ſaith <note place="margin">

                  <p>3. A tender conſcience. They that are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">S. </seg>62</label> called, have hearts afraid of ſin, ready to <note place="margin">Semper conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia ſervi Dei humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis eſſe debet, &amp; triſtis.</note> relent and melt at the occaſion of ſin or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; their hearts are like the thin ice of a ſmall froſt, which a ſmall weight will break: over the heart of an ungodly wretch you may drive cart-loads of ſin, and never make him bend under the burden: let whole volleys of comminations be diſcharged againſt him, he ſtartles no more than a man wholly deaf at the noiſe of thunder; common ordinary ſins they can ſwallow and make no bones of them; they laugh at the ratling and ſhaking of the ſpear; and account denuntiations of woe things not to be much feared. But it is far otherwiſe with a godly ſoul; it is all on a ſweat at the thoughts of putting forth its hand, though but to a ſmall ſin; and is ſo ſtrait-laced, that it cannot endure that ſin ſhould put its hand, or one of its fingers between: It is afraid of thoſe ſins which like thorns rend the skin of Chriſt, as well as thoſe which like ſpears pierce his ſides. <hi>I hate vain thoughts,</hi> ſaith <hi>David:</hi> though but <hi>thoughts,</hi> and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 113.</note> thoſe but <hi>vain;</hi> a very little matter will ſoon make ſuch an ones conſcience to bleed; they are very ſcrupulous about ſin; they are alſo afraid of God's judgements: when the Lion of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 120.</note> the tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> roars they tremble; nay,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:170336:157"/> when they ſee their heavenly father beating any of their brethren, it makes them ſtand quivering and ſhaking all the while; if threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they weep like tender hearted children. A tender conſcience is a companion of true converſion; a mended heart is a melting heart. It is like <hi>Joſiah,</hi> whoſe heart and conſcience the <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 27.</note> Lord commends for the tenderneſs and ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it: relenting affections, and renewed diſpoſitions are pairs; ſearch thine own heart concerning this temper; neither great nor little ſins it may be ſcare thee; thou canſt not melt for a ſmall miſcarriage; if thou canſt mourn for mighty tranſgreſſions that is all: Thou doſt not ſhake at the hearing of God's chiding; if ſo, thou art not effectually called.</p>
                  <p>4. Timely caution. Such have an heart ſo ſet <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">S. </seg>63</label> againſt ſin, that they are careful to avoid temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and occaſions thereto; where grace is, they ſhun ſin not only in the performance, but alſo in the preparative; not only in the device of it, but alſo in the deſire to it; not only: in the act, but in the allurement; they know that <note place="margin">Dum par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus est hoſtis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfice, ut nequitia elidatur in ſemine.</note> ſinful occaſions are the high way to ſinful acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they ſhun the ſcouts, that they fall not into the hands of their ſpiritual enemies. The Iſraelites might not marry with the ſons and daughters of the <hi>Cananites,</hi> for fear of drawing their hearts from God; if the ſoul of a Saint be ſubject to ſuch and ſuch a ſin in action, it ſhuns it in cogitation. <hi>Job</hi> made a covenant with his <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Job</hi> 31. 1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 1.</note> eyes, and <hi>David</hi> with his tongue. Saints are careful to keep the powder and the match aſunder; and the ſpark from the tinder; if
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170336:158"/> they be more prone to be proud of any exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal accomodations, they labour to deaden their affections to all temporal contentments; if paſſionate, they labour to avoid all occaſions of anger. As one <hi>Cotys</hi> an Heathen, of whom I <note place="margin">Plut. Mor.</note> have read, when his friend gave him a preſent of earthen pots and veſſels curiouſly made, but very brittle, broke them all to pieces preſently leſt if his ſervants ſhould caſually break any of them, he ſhould be too angry, for he was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally cholerick. Much more then ſhould a Chriſtian do ſo; he carefully obſerveth his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclination, that he may more vigorouſly oppoſe ſuitable temptations. But thou thruſteſt thy ſelf upon the mouth of the canon, and comeſt neer to the ſnare; thou flieſt too neer the candle, that it is no wonder if thou be caught, and thy wings burnt; this argues thou haſt not grace.</p>
                  <p>2. Obeying the Spirit. Where there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">S. </seg>64</label> ſanctification in the ſpirit, there is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial reſignation to the Spirit: thoſe that are truly changed by the Spirit, do throughly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Spirit: If that call they come; they give up themſelves to it, not only at firſt in converſion, but alſo afterwards in the whole courſe of their converſation; they acknowledge it to be their Lord, and accept of it for their leader; they march under its conduct, and are <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sanctum ſemper opus in me ſpira, ut cogitem, compelle, ut faciam. Cant.</hi> 1. 4.</note> willing to follow it as their commander: If the Spirit ſay the word, they preſently ſet upon the work. They ſay with the Spouſe, <hi>Draw us, we will run after thee.</hi> They are like the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion's ſervants, if the Spirit ſay, Go, they go;
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170336:158"/> if it ſay, Come, they come; if it ſay, Run, they run; if it ſay, Do this, they do it: but as for thee it is far otherwiſe. The Spirit hath called to mortification of thy ſin, oppoſition againſt thy luſt, elevation of thine heart; to renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of repentance, to actions of faith, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of thy will; but alas, though the Spirit call, yet thou doſt not hear, or if hear, yet not regard. Where there is grace, they obey the Spirit's calls, though contrary to fleſh and blood; but thou art as croſs to the Spirit as may be; you can yet remember the time when the Spirit ſpake to you, perſwaded and intreated you; and yet you have ſnuffed at its motions: It hath called you to diligence in duty, perſeverance in prayer, heart-workings in hearing the word; but you chuſe to be ruled rather by the liſt of your own mind, than the law of the Spirit's mouth; your croſs ſpirit hath countermanded God's holy ſpirit: It hath diſwaded you from your ſin, ſought to wean you from your wickedneſs, but you have been refractory: but a gracious heart liſtneth for the voice of the Spirit, and when it calleth, ſaith, Here am I; like a diligent ſcholler, that willingly regards his Maſter's word. The Spirit's words are welcome, its motions are muſick, its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands contenting unto thoſe that are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called. If the Spirit call at high mid-night, they are ready to riſe to do its pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>3. Submitting to trial. A changed heart is <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">S. </seg>65</label> willing to be tried and ſearched: and therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith ſweetly, <hi>Search me, O God, and</hi>

                     <pb n="300" facs="tcp:170336:159"/> It is a fine thing when one is willing to be ſearched by God or man: Thoſe that are in natural darkneſs care not for coming in to ſpiritual light; bad wares and dark ſhops agree well together; it is an argument they are too light, who are loth to be put into the ſcale; where there is a work of ſanctification, there is alſo a will to examination; ſuch are willing that their mettal ſhould be tried by a true touch-ſtone; they love to be dealt plainly withal by Chriſtian friends, by faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a kindneſs; and let him reprove me, it ſhall be an excellent oyl.</hi> But thou canſt not endure to be <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141. 5. <hi>

                     </note> ſifted and ſcanned; thou art for excuſation and not for examination; thou loveſt to be tickled rather then to be tried; it is a ſign they are ſpiritually ſcabby, who love to be ſcratched. Thou haſt ſuch a rotten skin, thou canſt not endure to be rubbed with a courſe cloth; a ſearching Sermon is to thee like a bitter potion. In your ſickneſs you are angry with thoſe that ſearch you, or queſtion your eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; though you have often been ſtirred up to ſelf examination, yet you would never buckle to the work: this ſhews you are not in an eſtate of grace.</p>
                  <p>4. Confiding with fear. The ſpiritual confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">S. </seg>66</label> of ſuch are mixt with ſpiritual fear; their hopes are not haughty preſumptions, but humble expectations; the flower of their aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is beſet with thorns of jealouſie; or elſe the wild beaſt of hell would ſoon break in and pluck it up. They take the Apoſtle's counſel,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170336:159"/> 
                     <hi>Be not high minded, but fear.</hi> They know they <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20.</note> ſtand in God's favour, yet they are afraid leſt they fall; they know they have grace, yet they are jealous leſt they loſe it. Thou that art all confidence and no care, art more an hopeful than an holy Chriſtian, and haſt cauſe to think thy eſtate not good. Though they ſtand, yet they take heed that they do not fall; the fear which <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 12.</note> they have is rather careful than deſpairing; other mens confidences may have more of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, but theſe thus tempered have more of truth; thoſe are not the confidences of converts that cauſe them to pluck up the hedge, to leave open the doors; yet ſuch confidences muſt be the only ſymptomes of grace with many. <label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>5. Its moving towards God. Such an heart is always in motion towards God; as it hath its being from the Lord, ſo its acting to the Lord. Its embleme may well be an heart with ſpread and extended wings, flying towards heaven, and this its <hi>Motto, Surſum corda:</hi> heaven-ward hearts: It is continually riſing and ſoaring towards heaven in its thoughts and meditations. Through grace it can ſay, as the Church of God, <hi>The deſire of our ſoul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee: with my</hi>

                     <hi>ſoul have I deſired thee in the night, yea, with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee early. Thales</hi> defined the ſoul to be a nature moving always; it is moſt true of the ſoul that is in an eſtate of grace; ſuch an heart longs for God, and lives with God; that time it accounts loſt in which its thoughts are not lift upwards; heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments are the ſubject of its thoughts; it is
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:170336:160"/> always ſtirring for God and his glory; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, deſiring, wiſhing, contemplating, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving, reſolving about heavenly matters: but as for thee, thine heart is like a piece of lead, it ſtirreth not to that which is good, but lively enough in its motions towards evil and ſin as its center; the thoughts thereof are like the eyes <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 24.</note> of the fool, which are in the ends of the earth. It is a ſtrange thing with thine heart to look upward, or to take a few ſteps up the hill of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs towards the Lord; thou ſitteſt upon the rooſt of thy carnal contentments all the week long, and never offereſt once to get upon the wing to the region of glory, to the preſence of God.</p>
                  <p>6. Its affecting. There is never an one that truly <label type="milestone">

The people expreſſed their love to <hi>Jonathan</hi> in ſtanding between him and death, becauſe he wrought great ſalvation in Iſrael: Upon the ſame account do Saints expreſs love to their ſpiritual Saviour; they ſay and think it is pity but love ſhould have love; he hath laid down his life for them, and they think they can give no leſs then their heart-love to him: but thou haſt no love to Chriſt, thou wilt not part with ought for his ſake; thou ſeeſt no ſuch greatneſs in him that he ſhould be liked, no ſuch goodneſs that he ſhould be loved; if thou have any love towards him, it is but from the teeth, and not in truth; but common and complemental, not cordial.</p>
                  <p>7. Improving aſſurance. The incomes of aſſurance ſuch have from the Spirit, make <label type="milestone">

It is marrow to their bones, and health to their fleſh; the joy of the Lord is the ſtrength of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 10.</note> their ſouls; intimations of God's love they uſe as invitations to a good life; when the Lord ſpeaks peace to their hearts, they think
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:170336:161"/> they are bound to act piety with their hands; if God ſpeak peace to them, they dare not <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 8.</note> turn to folly; peace of conſcience with ſuch, is mother to piety in converſation; if they have a ſenſe of acceptance with God, it makes them ſeek for more acquaintance with his ways; when they have but a ſip of this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, how it fills them with activity for the Lord; they deſire not this Sun-ſhine to play in, but to work in: but as for thee, thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences putrifie and breed corruption, and thy ſecurity ſin. Thou thinkeſt thou art one <note place="margin">Non ſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re potest coeleſte regnum, cui ſuper propria regnare membra adhuc non donatur.</note> of God's, and ſhalt be ſaved, and therefore takeſt liberty to thy ſelf, to fulfil the luſts of thine own heart; thou haſt then no grace; yet this is the way of many wretched crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if they can but fancy the ſureneſs of their condition, they fear not the ſinfulneſs of their courſes.

                     <hi>ye may be ſincere.</hi> They have their inſide and their outſide all of one piece; of all things hypocriſie goeth moſt againſt their ſtomacks; they are what they would ſeem to be, and they ſeem as they are. As the Heathen ſaid, ſo is it here, there muſt be nothing fained <note place="margin">In ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citiâ nihil fictum aut ſimulatum, Tull.</note> and counterfeit in the friendſhip between God and a Saint.

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:170336:162"/> if you be a linſey-woolſey Chriſtian, you are not of the right make; God's people are not open Saints and ſecret ſinners; they are not all ſhew, they have ſubſtance too; if they were anatomized, their inſides would be found as white as their outſides; their hearts as well as their hands are waſhed; their ſpirit beareth a part in all they do; the glory of God, the ſalvation of their ſouls are the compaſſes they ſteer their courſe by; glory, credit, reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, gain, &amp;c. are not the white that they ſhoot the arrows of Religion at: but it is far otherwiſe with thee, as thou mayſt eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive if thou take but a tranſitory view of thy ſelf.</p>

Saints are ſingular; other mens pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices are no rule for their performances.

                  <p>10. Prizing communion. Laſtly, they <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">S. </seg>80</label> make the enjoyment of God and Chriſt their <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> their chief good, and prize communion with the divine being above all things. <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and of my cup; thou maintaineſt my lot.</hi>

The participation of God and Chriſt is the ultimate end of a gracious ſouls pantings and pains; its thoughts, endeavours, contrivances have a tendency thereunto; it makes this the end of its life and liberty, the end of its deſires and duties, the end of its prayers and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, to enjoy its God and Saviour here and hereafter; other mens thoughts, affections, labours are about tranſitory things; and that whereabout men lay out the choice of their intentions and indeavours, they make their chief good. Thus have I finiſhed this uſe of examination, whereon I have inſiſted the longer, and which I have diverſified the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, becauſe it is of very great concernment, to know whether or no we be truly converted.
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:170336:163"/> I requeſt you, my dear friends, to ſet upon this work ſpeedily and ſeriouſly, delay it not a moment; pray to God to teach you ſpiritual Arithmetick, that you may know how rightly to caſt up your ſouls account; and if upon due ſearch you find your ſelves effectually called, then liſten eſpecially to the firſt part of the enſuing and laſt uſe; and if you find your ſelves uncalled, lend an ear and an eye heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the latter part of it.</p>
