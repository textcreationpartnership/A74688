            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe≈øe Sermons coming abroad into the world, I thought meet to command them to vi≈øit and ≈øalute you, where they fir≈øt drew their breath.</p>
            <p>They have formerly been preached to your ears, they are now pre≈øented to your eyes; the Lord print them upon your hearts. I take it to be my duty, (though I be the lowermo≈øt of the u≈øhers in Chri≈øt's School, yet) according to the mea≈øure of my talent, to try all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øions for the weal of your ≈øouls; and how would mine heart be enlarged with thanks to the Lord, if my poor endeavours might be crowned with ≈øucces? and though the≈øe things have been communicated to you formerly, yet (becau≈øe we are ≈ølow to receive and retain divine truths) to write the ≈øame things, that I have ≈øpoken, to me ≈øhall not be grievous; and to you I hope the Lord will make it ≈øafe: Nay, though my ≈øervice for your ≈øouls in any kind were doubled, yea, treble, yet ≈øhould I abundantly rejoyce in the labour of the
<pb facs="tcp:170336:3"/> harde≈øt tasks, if thereby through the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the Almighty, I might ≈øee Satans forts taken, and forces routed, and ≈øin marching out of your hearts and lives with bag and baggage, and the Lord Je≈øus with the ble≈ø≈øed train of his ≈øpirit's graces enthroned and ≈øet up in the mid≈øt of you. To which end Iearne≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly de≈øire that the Lord would be plea≈øed to ble≈øs this, &amp; all my other labours; &amp; that you would be plea≈øed to accept of my coun≈øel, as in the Book, ≈øo in this Epi≈øtle. And that</p>
            <p>1. More generally. 2. More particularly, with re≈øpect to the en≈øuing Treati≈øe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. More generally.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Take heed of error and here≈øie. They are reckoned in Scripture among≈øt the works of the fle≈øh. They are the ≈øecret underminers of that which is good, notwith≈øtanding their well-complexioned face.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Get knowledge. Ignorance is the root of iniquity. In times of light to live in darkne≈øs is mo≈øt ≈øad.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Do not impri≈øon, but improve your knowledge. <hi>To him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is ≈øin,</hi> [with a witne≈øs] <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 17. Knowledge without grace, is but like a jewel in a ≈øwines ≈ønout, or a pearl in a toads head.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Keep clo≈øe to the Ordinances. Keep up in your hearts a love to them. Come once to
<pb facs="tcp:170336:3"/> ≈ølight and turn your back upon them, and you put the reins into the Divels hands.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Love ≈øound and ≈øoul≈øearching preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; never di≈øta≈øte it, it is be≈øt for your ≈øouls; it is whole≈øome though not tooth≈øome.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Be much in examination of your ≈øelves; weigh your ≈øelves in God's ≈øcales: will you know every thing, and be ignorant only of the ≈øtate of your ≈øouls?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Content not your ≈øelves with a form, but look afte the power of godline≈øs; the name without the nature of a Chri≈øtian will little avail you: forget not what I have taught you from <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 21..</p>
            <p n="8">8. Take heed of the world, and the cares thereof. Do not ≈øo fa≈øten your thoughts to earth, as to be ≈øtrangers to heaven. Be not ≈øo careful of your bodies, as to be carele≈øs of your ≈øouls.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Look to your families: let Chri≈øt come in there. Train up your children and ≈øervants religiou≈øly; let your hou≈øes be as ≈øo many Churches. Neglect here is the corrupted ≈øpring that ≈øends forth puddle-≈øtreams into Eccle≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈øtical and Civil ≈øocieties; without the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, your hou≈øes will be but the Divels ≈øhops.</p>
            <p n="10">10. In your places di≈øcountenance ≈øin and profane≈øs; encourage goodne≈øs. Improve your power, e≈øtate, age, &amp;c. for Chri≈øt's glory.</p>
            <p n="11">
               <pb facs="tcp:170336:4"/> 11. Maintain love towards each other; follow peace and holine≈øs; Love is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent grace.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Be very careful to ≈øanctifie the Lord's Sabbaths publikely and privately: They are God's dole<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> days; be not unwilling to wait at the po≈øts of his gates for his alms.</p>
            <p n="2">2. More particularly with re≈øpect to the en≈øuing Treati≈øe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Look upon this little piece as an help to bring to remembrance what hath formerly been taught you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Take the coun≈øel therein as from your Mini≈øter, Friend, and Lover, who earne≈øtly de≈øires your eternal ≈øalvation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Read it not out of novelty, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Pray over it, and for me, that I may be the better enabled to di≈øcharge my duty in watching over your ≈øouls.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Compare it with the Scriptures, and ≈øo far as it harmonizeth with them embrace it. I ≈øhall here put a period, and conclude, not cea≈øing to be mindful of you at the throne of grace, and to make mention of you in my prayers, who am</p>

            <p>I have formerly had in my thoughts to draw up ≈øome admonitions and cautions for the good of your ≈øouls, which as a father care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of your eternal weal, I might leave with you as a <hi>fathers ble≈ø≈øing,</hi> as the be≈øt legacy I can bequeath to you; but tho≈øe being not hatched and the≈øe fledged and compleated, I could not but put them into your hands, not knowing (though my ≈øelf wtth your loving mother be in the prime of our years, having but newly pa≈øt the noon of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi>

            <p>I have ≈øix of you in the land of the living, Oh that the Lord would make you his! So far as I know mine own heart, (though the heart of man, and ≈øo mine is very deceitful) I profe≈øs ≈øeriou≈øly, that how low ≈øoever your condition ≈øhould be for temporals, yet if the Lord would be plea≈øed to be≈øtow a new heart upon you, I ≈øhould abundantly rejoyce, yea, more than to ≈øee you ≈øit upon the highe≈øt pinacle of worldly advancement. I am full of fears and de≈øires in reference to your ≈øouls good; and though now you be tender and young, and ≈øo little ≈øen≈øible, and not ≈øo fit for this or other books, yet if it plea≈øe God to lengthen out the thread of your lives, which I pray for, then take a word of advice from your father: oh that God would ble≈øs it to you!</p>
            <p>Study throughly the nature of original ≈øin, and that pravity that is diffu≈øed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your natures. Remember that you are born in ≈øin, and ≈øo will live and die if not changed by grace. The Lord change you for his Chri≈øt's ≈øake. Let the Scriptures be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in your eyes; they are the book of books; read them often, and heedfully. Make great con≈øcience of obedience to your parents and ≈øuperiors. <hi>Remember</hi> your
<pb facs="tcp:170336:7"/> creator in the days of your youth; make good u≈øe of your young time; flee youthful lu≈øts; take heed of the beginnings of ≈øin; beware of pride, lying, vain company, &amp;c. Be willing to learn and be taught the things of God, and your ≈øouls good. I mu≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, or mine Epi≈øtles will ≈øwell too much.

            <p>RElations and friend≈øhip are the pillars of human ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, great comforts of our lives; love is the ≈øinew of friend≈øhip, and religion is the life of this love. What is love without religion, but a ≈øen≈øual affection? and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance without love, but flattery and di≈ø≈øimulation? ≈øo that religion is the centre to the lines of love and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip, and that wherein they live and have their being. <hi>Non nobis ≈øolum nati ≈øumus, We were not born for our ≈øelves alone,</hi> ≈øaid the Heathen Orator. And if for others, for their good; and if for their good, then their be≈øt good, or their good in the be≈øt re≈øpects thereof. God made and knit us together in bonds, not to further or let each other alone in ≈øin, (which we are apt to do through the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of ba≈øe fle≈øh) but to admoni≈øh and help each other on towards grace and glory. Though I mu≈øt confe≈øs I fail too much in the duty of every of my relations wherein I ≈øtand; yet I ble≈øs God that he hath helped and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged me in ≈øome mea≈øure to deal with divers of you in the way of private admonition, which I hope hath not been altogether fruitle≈øs. It is a precious duty, I wi≈øh it were more put in u≈øe and practice.</p>
            <p>I have had ≈øometimes wi≈øhes (though the thing can hardly be attained) that we might all meet together at ≈øome times, (e≈øpecially we that are more neerly related to each other) not only for civil ≈øociety, but al≈øo and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally for ≈øpiritual advantage.

Come, let

            <p>Some of you may be yet knee-deep and more in the clay of a natural condition, ≈øtanding at a great di≈øtance from the father of light. The Lord pull your feet out, and ≈øet them on the rock <hi>Chri≈øt.</hi>

            <p>Others of you may have ≈øome early glimmerings of the ≈øpirit dawning upon your ≈øouls. The Lord cau≈øe the ≈øun of righteou≈øne≈øs to ri≈øe upon you with healing under his wings, and bring your bloomings and buddings to ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and maturity.</p>
            <p>Some others may have a through work of grace upon their hearts; the Lord make ≈øuch thankful, (for it is an ine≈øtimable mercy) and keep their feet that they fall not.</p>
            <p>Various are your conditions in regard of temporals and ≈øpirituals; various are your relations to, and acquaintance with me: what≈øoever the one or the other be, let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be a bar to keep you from accepting the coun≈øel of the holy Gho≈øt, which is ≈øent in love, let it therefore be ≈øo taken.

            <p>THou may≈øt wonder to ≈øee me add to the pile and heap of books. Not glory, nor gain (unle≈øs of God, of ≈øouls) (though my heart be very evil, and have the ≈øeeds of all ≈øin in it) are the wheels on which I move in this labour. Not affectation, but affection to my heavenly Father, to my earthly Friends, put me on to this. Some years ≈øince in my publike preaching. I went through the chief heads in Divinity, and when I came to this of Effectual Calling, I in≈øi≈øted the longer upon it, becau≈øe it was very practical, and of great concernment. I found it then making ≈øome impre≈ø≈øion, I hope it may do ≈øo now; if but one ≈øoul be thereby turned in to the Lord, it is worth my pains, though a thou≈øand times more. I was de≈øirous to communicate it to my friends, to whom I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, for their good if the Lord be plea≈øed to ble≈øs it. It had been a weary task to have tran≈øcribed many copies; I was re≈øolved therefore to take the ≈øhorte≈øt cut. It is a complaint that the Pre≈øs is oppre≈ø≈øed, and not without cau≈øe; yet much Printing I think is no more to be indicted then much Preaching, if ≈øo be the matter be ≈øound and ≈øavoury. That feminine toleration that Midwives ≈øo many ≈øpurious births into the world, and that licentious liberty whereby any one and any thing may preach and be preached, are well worthy of cen≈øure and ≈øharp animadver≈øions, it is hard to ≈øay which more. Much reading is a wearine≈øs to the fle≈øh, and ≈øo may much hearing, yet if either be rendred under God a means of conviction and conver≈øion to the ≈øpirit it is no matter. <hi>Daniel</hi> got knowledge of things of concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by books, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 2. I ≈øee the Lord owneth and ble≈ø≈øeth reading as well as hearing, printing as well as preaching. (though of all means of grace I take <hi>preaching<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
               </hi> to be the King:) Mine own ≈øoul through the mercy of God (for ever ble≈ø≈øed be his name) hath received ≈øome good (if it be not pre≈øumption to ≈øay ≈øo) that way, as well as by the preaching
<pb facs="tcp:170336:9"/> of the word; and though this be drawn up by a weak worthle≈øs creature, yet God I ≈øee ≈øometimes makes u≈øe of, and ble≈ø≈øeth a wooden as well as a golden in≈øtrument. And though hereby I expo≈øe my ≈øelf who am weak to the acute judgement of parted and learned men, yet I weigh it not, if but one ≈øoul may be gained and brought in to God by this ≈øervice, as I hope there ≈øhall, and the Lord rai≈øeth mine heart to ≈øome comfortable expectation thereof.

                  </head>
                  <p>IT is a Work, and the fir≈øt ≈øpecial Work of <note place="margin">Defin.</note> Gods Spirit by the Mini≈øtery of the Word, whereby a man, or woman is brought out of an E≈øtate of nature into an E≈øtate of grace, out of ≈øelf to Chri≈øt, and of va≈ø≈øals of ≈øin are made Ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels of the God of Sion; to walk ≈øtrictly with him in the cour≈øe of their lives, to the peace of their Soules, to the prai≈øe of the glory of his grace. Col. 1. 11, 12. <hi>Which hath made us meet to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in light; who hath delivered us from the power of darkne≈ø≈øe, and hath tran≈ølated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son.</hi> Where I ≈øuppo≈øe dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe is not onely meant of ignorance, which is one part of a natural E≈øtate, but al≈øo of ≈øin in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, which is ≈øometimes called by the name of <note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 5, 6.</note> darkne≈øs; wherewith as with a thick Cloud the whole Man is envelopped &amp; wrapped. 1 Pet. 2. 4, 5. <hi>To whom coming as unto a living Stone; ye al≈øo as lively Stones are built up a Spiritual Hou≈øe, an Holy Prie≈øthood to offer up Spiritual Sacrifices, acceptable to God by Je≈øus Chri≈øt:</hi> So likewi≈øe the 1. of <hi>James,</hi> Ver≈øe 18. I ≈øhall a little unfold this rich hanging, that you may have a more full view of it: It is a Work, not a Notion, chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170336:12"/> fancy, or conceit: but a real Work.</p>
                  <p>It is the fir≈øt Work upon the Soul: Prede≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <note place="margin">Electio e≈øt amor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinativus, non colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivus.</note> is without, this within: Prede≈øtination is in the heart of God, this is Gods coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of Man; that did ordain, this doth order.</p>
                  <p>Sanctification, (for ≈øome di≈øtingui≈øh it from <note place="margin">A≈ø≈øemb. Confe≈ø.</note> effectual calling, though others do not,) and per≈øeverance, &amp;c. are after, this before; this marcheth in the Head of the Heavenly Troop, and ble≈ø≈øed Train of Gods Works upon the Soule.</p>
                  <p>It is a ≈øpecial Work, not a common, which the reprobate may have: it is a di≈øtingui≈øhing through Work; not ≈øuch a work as a Man may have, and yet come ≈øhort of the glory, becau≈øe ≈øhort of the grace of God; and be left many miles on this ≈øide the Region of happine≈ø≈øe: it is not onely a ≈øaving, but a truely Sanctifying Work, as ≈øome di≈øtingui≈øh; and ≈øo Sanctifying as indeed ≈øaving, not onely in that mean and potentially, but in the end and actually.</p>
                  <p>It is the Work of Gods Spirit, the po≈øterity of the Holy-Gho≈øt. 3 John 6. 8. It is the blowing, or breathing of the Spirit; the Child of Heaven: all the meanes in the World cannot make a Saint without the influence of the Spirit; yet that works by the Word, that is the In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the hand of the Spirit, for the new moulding of ≈øinful hearts.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit and the Word go together: the Spirit primarily, the Word ≈øecondarily, the one as Ma≈øter, the other as Servant.</p>
                  <p>And the≈øe Work not upon a part, but the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170336:13"/> whole: This Work is diffu≈øive, and ≈øpread throughout the whole Man; Soul and Body; inwards and outwards: It is the bringing them out of nature; from a Dungeon to a Court; from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan;</hi> from ≈øin to Sanctity; from gracele≈ø≈øene≈ø≈øe to graciou≈øne≈øs; from the Suburbs of Hell to the City of God: The Soul is now led by the Spirits hand from ≈øelf, from natural, ≈øinful, moral, Religious ≈øelf to Chri≈øt, who is all in all unto it.</p>
                  <p>Now obeying the call of the Spirit, (who leads it in clean wayes) it walkes ≈øtrictly: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Soul was in the Field of ≈øin, now in the Garden of grace; before in the common Road of ungodline≈ø≈øe, now in the private walk of Piety; before it was Lawle≈ø≈øe, now it walks by Rule and Line.</p>
                  <p>And what is the end of all this? Is it not Peace here, and Peace hereafter? Ble≈ø≈øedne≈øs <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P≈ø.</hi> 119. 1.</note> in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, ble≈ø≈øedne≈øs in rever≈øion: Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and Holine≈øs are Confederates, are Twins: But more than this, it tends to Gods glory: Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> Doxologize, prai≈øe, give thanks for this?

                  <p>Thus have I de≈øcanted upon this ble≈ø≈øed Work, an Embleme whereof in a good mea≈øure you have in the Parable of the prodigal Son.</p>

Nay, the ≈øpirit hath gone ≈øo far with you, that it hath convinced you of thus much, that you ≈øhould be better than you are, and yet for all this you are the ≈øame man and woman: It hath convinced you of Chri≈øt's readine≈ø≈øe to e≈øpou≈øe you, and yet you have not been willing to give your ≈øins a Bill of divorcement, and to put them away; it hath made con≈øcience its depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (your bo≈øome Friend that knows you well, and ≈øhould have great intere≈øt in you,) <note place="margin">Con≈øcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia e≈øt cordis ≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia.</note> and hath ≈øet it on work to ≈øpeak to, and to deal with you, but all will not do.

The day of your life hath been not a Winter's, but a Summer's day: You have followed many of your relations, and acquaintance to the grave, who have been younger than you, but you live ≈øtill. The Lord hath made you a long lea≈øe, and it is not yet expired. He hath cut down ≈øome a≈ø≈øoon as they have budded and blo≈ø≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; but he letteth you ≈øtand ≈øtill: He hath ≈øtopped the breath of ≈øome, ≈øoon after he hath given it them, but thy breath is ≈øtill in thy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrils. Thy radical heat is not put out, thy ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical moi≈øture is not yet dried up: He hath cau≈øed thy Sun to ≈øtand ≈øtill in the Firmament, and hath kept it from going down at noon day; he hath lengthened thy time from the ≈øpring of youth to the autumne of ripe and mature years. And yet thou ha≈øt brought forth no

It was the aggravation of <hi>Jezebel</hi>'s ≈øin, that the Lord <hi>gave her ≈øpace to repent of her fornication, and ≈øhe repented not.</hi> Revel. 2. 21. It is ≈øad that thy <note place="margin">Virtutes faciunt dies bones.</note> dayes have been great, but not good; that thy dayes have been many, and thy grace but mean. Thou ha≈øt through the Lord's clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy renewed thy youth as the Eagle; but though the Lord hath been calling, thy heart is not renewed. The Lord hath added years to thy daies, as he did to <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> but thou ha≈øt <note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 6.</note> not yet added ≈øanctity to thy civility, nor pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the power to thy profe≈ø≈øion in the forme. Thou art well ≈øtricken in years, but thou ha≈øt never yet fully ≈øtricken a Covenant with the Lord. Thou art entred a great way into the ≈øcores, but woulde≈øt never yet enter cordially into the School of Chri≈øt. The Lord hath cut off many in their ≈øins, while they have been acting unrighteou≈øne≈ø≈øe; as the drunkard that ≈øaid, he ≈øhould never die, yet fell down a pair of ≈øtaires pre≈øently, and died: while you have e≈øcaped, and your life hath been given you for a prey; and yet all this while you have gotten no grace. You have ≈øeen of the fruit of your body it may be to the third generation, and yet the Lord hath ≈øeen no fruits of grace from your ≈øoul: you have been fruitful according to the fle≈øh, but barren according to the ≈øpirit. You have lived ≈øo long as to have an hoary head, but not ≈øo long as to have an holy heart. Hath the Lord lengthened out your daies to a longer date, than the daies of many of your ≈øtock and Family, and yet are you without
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170336:110"/> grace? Are you ancient in years, and yet have not come in, to the ancient of dayes? Is invaluable time of no value with you?

                  <p>Ah poor ≈øoul, is it not a very great evil that the Lord hath been laying ≈øiege to thine heart, the≈øe thirty, fourty, fifty years, or more, and yet thou ha≈øt ≈øtood up, and ≈øtouted it out again≈øt him; that thou ha≈øt ≈øo long been called by him, and yet thy deaf vile heart hath not hearkned

                  <p>Great is the force of need, and the ≈øence thereof, to ≈øet the heart on de≈øiring, and the hand on doing; and he that knows his need of any thing which he conceives to be of weight and moment, will through fire and water for the attainment thereof: nece≈ø≈øity will take no denial, and knows how to object again≈øt all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øes, and put-offs.

Believer, Chri≈øt hath not only united thy per≈øon to him≈øelf hypo≈øtatically, but thy nature al≈øo my≈øtically. The neere≈øt and ≈øtronge≈øt rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on earth are made u≈øe of as emblems to ≈øhadow out the noble conjunction between a Chri≈øtian and his Chri≈øt in heaven.

You were called to be girt to him with the girdle of faith, fa≈øtened with the knot of true≈øt and indi≈ø≈øoluble love; Chri≈øt is in thee, and thou art in Chri≈øt. Chri≈øt and others are as far a≈øunder as Ea≈øt from We≈øt, and North from

He gives for a dowry to his Spou≈øe, no le≈ø≈øe than a part in his whole po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion. Where there is purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Chri≈øt's ≈øpirit, there is participation of Chri≈øt's merit; and can the world afford a portion an≈øwerable to this? What would≈øt thou, what can≈øt thou have more than this? Believing, beloved ≈øoul, know what thy ≈øtate and thy priviledge is, that thou may≈øt rejoyce in the Lord, and that the joy of the Lord may be thy ≈øtrength. Can you think of this and not triumph? can you have this in ≈øerious meditation, and not be rai≈øed with joyful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration? If joy and comfort belong to any, <note place="margin">Est gaudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, quod non datur impiis, ≈øed eis, qui te gratis colunt.</note> then certainly to the Saints; and if upon any, then upon this account of their union with and intere≈øt in Chri≈øt. Surely it cannot but make thee ≈øtrain the ≈øtrings one note higher in thy ≈øpiritual mu≈øick, to think of this. There is a precious Pearl called an Union: This union with Chri≈øt is no doubt a Pearl of great price; better than any that ever yet adorned the head of greate≈øt Princes. It is
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170336:135"/> the choice flower in your ≈øpiritual garland; the gloriou≈øe≈øt feather in all your plume. It is ≈øuch a dignity, that but a few attain unto. The name of union is ≈øweet, the nature of it is advantagious, of what nature ≈øoever it be, whether natural, civil, &amp;c. It is the ≈øupporter and the ≈øafety of people and places: What then is union with Je≈øus Chri≈øt? fellow≈øhip with the Son, and by him with the Father?

Many Heathens have gone thus far, who never learned the truth as it is in Je≈øus: They were ju≈øt in their way, but they were not ju≈øtified; they were ≈øober
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:170336:141"/> and ≈øerious, but not ≈øanctified.
